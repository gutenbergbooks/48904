<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="pc2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> kindness is at times rewarded
with ingratitude, and even positive injury, it is by
no means so frequent an occurrence as persons
naturally censorious, or whose minds have been
soured by an unblest experience, would have us
suppose.</p>

<p>Benefits conferred usually excite gratitude, and
sometimes, when the donors have passed away
are repaid, with interest, to their posterity.</p>

<p>The story of Arthur Brown presents a striking
illustration of this principle. Lashed to a raft,
perishing with cold and hunger in the edge of
the surf, he is rescued by Captain Rhines, who,
when a boy, poor and unable either to read or
write, had been instructed and started in business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
by Arthur’s father, who was afterwards lost
at sea. The old captain, discovering, in the person
he had perilled his life to save, the only son
of his benefactor, receives him with open arms,
with a nobility of soul that strengthens our faith
in human nature, freely bestowing both time and
property to aid the son and family of his benefactor,
and repay the old debt. His efforts in
this direction, together with those of the young
man to help himself, at a most stirring period
of our country’s history, the adventures growing
out of those efforts, and the consequent development
of character, will, we trust, prove interesting,
and not without instruction.</p>

<p>Some references have necessarily been made
to characters of the “Elm Island Series,” the
reasons for which are given in the introductory
chapter, and the references so explained as to
render the connection plain to the reader.</p>

<p class="pch">INTRODUCTORY.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IN the series of books denominated the “Elm
Island Stories” (commencing at the period
when the old “Continental Congress,” which had
fought the war of the revolution, was superseded
by the Federal Government, and running through
successive years) were introduced certain characters
in whom our juvenile readers became so
much interested, that they have assured us they
could not abruptly surrender their acquaintance,
at least not without some slight knowledge of
their future prospects, especially as we were compelled
to conclude our tale when most of them
were on the very threshold of manhood. Desiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to gratify, and, at the same time, render them
somewhat familiar with the history and progress
of their native land in those snapping times included
between the outbreak of the French revolution
and the embargo, so prolific in gain and
adventure to those possessing the enterprise, and
daring to profit by them, and during which American
commerce took such mighty strides, we must
of necessity, at the commencement of this volume,
make some slight reference to persons and places
previously described. For the benefit of those
who have not read the former series, we introduce
a brief sketch, referring those who may desire
more accurate knowledge to those books.</p>

<p>Our old acquaintances can pursue, with this
chapter, the course we used to adopt, when compelled
to read one of Buckminster’s sermons aloud
to the family, after having been twice to meeting,
brought home the texts and heads of the
sermon, and to Sabbath school&mdash;<i>skip</i>, skipped all
we dared to, skipped all we could.</p>

<p>The scene of the “Elm Island Stories” is laid
in eastern Maine, when it was little better than
a forest, save a rim of clearings and incipient
towns along the sea-shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Rhines, who lived on the shore at a
place named from him and his ancestors Rhineville,
but then a plantation unincorporated, was a
noble specimen of a sea captain&mdash;shrewd, kindly,
self-made, of a daring nature, controlled by clear,
cool judgment.</p>

<p>His son Ben, possessing all the sterling qualities
of his father, is a giant in strength, and in
the very prime of life. Though in general of
most even temper, and only by long provocations
excited to wrath, yet, when thoroughly roused,
he was terrible; hence his name, <i>Lion Ben</i>. Becoming
enamoured of Sally Hadlock, who will only
marry him on condition that he relinquishes the
sea, he buys Elm Island, situated among the breakers,
six miles from the main land, and inaccessible
at some periods by reason of the surf; fertile as to
soil, and covered with a heavy growth of timber.
With nothing to depend upon but their hands, and
obliged to mortgage the island at the outset, this
resolute pair sit down among the woods to
achieve independence. He is greatly assisted in
all his plans and purposes by Uncle Isaac Murch,
a man in middle life, who, in boyhood, was captured
by the Penobscot Indians, and adopted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
their tribe&mdash;a most shrewd, resolute, genial being,
with very strong attachment to youth, their
unfailing friend and ally in every good purpose.</p>

<p>While Lion Ben is cutting off the spars and raising
crops to pay for the island, some plunderers
from the British Provinces, seeing but one house
on the island, and supposing they had but little resistance
to encounter, landed and insulted Ben’s
wife. She flies to her husband, who is at work
near by in the woods, who encounters and nearly
kills the intruders. Among them is an English
orphan boy, by the name of Charlie Bell, who had
shipped with them as cook, being ignorant of their
character. He remains, and is adopted by Lion
Ben. He turns out to be a boy of most excellent
principle, of remarkable mechanical genius, and
learns the trade of a ship carpenter; makes the
acquaintance of Captain Rhines’s youngest boy,
John, and of Fred Williams, the miller’s son.</p>

<p>Fred is a boy naturally smart, and inclined to
mischief. By associating with a miserable wretch
by the name of Pete Clash, an importation from
the Provinces, and another by the name of Godsoe,
a home production, he is led into evil courses.
These boys, while in the woods one day, plotting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
mischief against Uncle Isaac, being surprised by
John Rhines, and finding that he will expose
them, attempt to flog him; but he is rescued by
his dog Tige, who tears Pete and Fred, injuring
Fred so severely that he is at the point of death,
which brings him to reflection and reform.</p>

<p>Pete Clash, attempting to meddle with Uncle
Isaac’s fish flakes, is caught by the old hunter
in a wolf trap, and so threatened and frightened
by him, that he leaves the place, together with
Godsoe. John, Fred, and Charlie now became
fast friends, and Uncle Isaac their mutual friend
and adviser.</p>

<p>John Rhines becomes a blacksmith, Fred works
with his father in the mill. Charlie and John
accumulate money by labor and ventures sent
to the West Indies, and set up Fred in trade.
These three boys, with another by the name of
Isaac Murch, a protégé of Captain Rhines, <i>undertake</i>
to build a vessel, and <i>do</i> build her, and send
her to the French West Indies, calling her the
Hard-scrabble, in commemoration of the desperate
nature of the undertaking. She arrives at Martinique
at a lucky moment, and pays for herself,
and more too. They afterwards build another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
called the Casco, of larger dimensions, of which
Isaac Murch becomes the master, surrendering the
Hard-scrabble to another captain. Joe Griffin, to
whom reference is made, is a friend of Lion Ben,
a mighty man with an axe, a great wrestler,
and kind-hearted, but a most inveterate practical
joker.</p>

<p>Walter Griffin, a younger brother of Joe, inheriting
all the grit of this rugged race, enters the
store of Fred Williams as a clerk; but the Griffin
blood rebels under the monotony and constraint,
and he takes to the water. Peterson, the
black pilot, was for many years addicted to intemperance.
During that period some roguish
boys got him into a store when intoxicated,
poured molasses on his head, then applied flour,
alternating the layers, till his head was as large
as a half bushel; for many years after which he
was known by the nickname of Flour, but, having
become a sober and industrious man, has
accumulated property, is respected by the whole
community, and the nickname is forgotten.</p>

<p>The period at which this series commences
is after the French revolution, when the star of
Nelson was rising above the horizon, and Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Bonaparte, a colonel of the artillery, was
planting batteries at Toulon, and giving the English
blockading fleet a taste of his quality.</p>

<p>These young men are now in possession of
capital. John Rhines is living at home with his
father; Fred is engaged in trade, and just married
to a daughter of Captain Rhines. Charlie Bell is
living on a farm in a most beautiful spot, called
“Pleasant Cove,” upon which he chanced to stumble
one lovely night in summer while sailing,
became enraptured with and bought it, married
another daughter of the captain, and settled down
on it in a log house, while it was a forest, has
one child, now a babe, and having built the Casco
on his own shore, hopes to be able to cultivate
the soil (an occupation he dearly loves), and to
carry out those ideas of taste and beauty which
in childhood he had gathered from the vales and
ancestral homes of his native land.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE WRECK AND THE RESCUE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IT was the middle of October, about ten o’clock
in the forenoon; there was no rain falling, but
it was blowing&mdash;O, how it was blowing!&mdash;a tearing
gale from the south-west, which roared through,
the tree tops, and there was a tremendous sea in
the bay. But under the lee of Pleasant Point,
entirely sheltered from the wind by the high land
and the woods, a shooting match had just been
abruptly broken off by Sol Chase (a boy of sixteen,
who put up the turkeys) declaring that it
was no kind of use to set up, if such marksmen
as Joe Griffin and Uncle Isaac were going to
shoot.</p>

<p>“Well, Sol, we won’t fire any more,” said Joe;
“you boys may do your own shooting.”</p>

<p>“Let us do something we can all do,” said
Charlie. “Uncle Isaac, let us play knives. I’ll
blaze this pine tree for a mark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Blaze a pine tree! Half of you won’t be able
to hit the tree. Take the barn door.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t got knives,” said Ricker.</p>

<p>“I’ve got my hunting knife,” said Uncle Isaac;
“one knife will do for the whole of us.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got an Indian tomahawk in the house,”
said Charlie; “one that you gave me, Uncle
Isaac, long ago.”</p>

<p>A bull’s eye was marked out on the barn door;
the knife was held by the point of the blade, and
flung. Uncle Isaac, when, after the first two trials,
he had ascertained his distance, hit the centre
of the target every time; Joe Griffin nearly as
often; Charlie, Fred, and John, who had at other
times practised a good deal with Uncle Isaac and
each other, twice out of three times.</p>

<p>“It takes Walter Griffin to throw a knife. He’d
hit that mark every time.”</p>

<p>“I wish he was here,” said Fred. “I feel,
since he went to sea, as though about half of me
was gone.”</p>

<p>As to the rest, some hit within six inches;
others didn’t hit the door; and others flung the
knife so that it struck flatways, or on the end
of the handle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now let’s throw the tomahawk,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>In this game none of them could approach Uncle
Isaac, who flung it with a force and precision
that would soon have made a breach in Charlie’s
barn door; but as the rest could not fling it with
any accuracy, they soon tired of it.</p>

<p>“I’ll put up a mark for you, Uncle Isaac,” said
Joe Bradish.</p>

<p>He had a soft hat, bran new; put it on for the
first time that day.</p>

<p>“What will you give me for a shot at my hat,
at six hundred yards?”</p>

<p>“Three shillings.”</p>

<p>“Done.”</p>

<p>Bradish rolled his hat carefully up, and thrust it
into a mortise in the post of a rail fence.</p>

<p>“I thought I was to have the whole bigness of
the hat to fire at; that’s a small mark for such a
long distance.”</p>

<p>“That’s just like him,” said Charlie; “always
doing some mean, underhand trick.”</p>

<p>“You was to fire at the hat. There’s the hat.
Now measure off the six hundred yards,” said
Bradish.</p>

<p>“Don’t measure it that way,” said Uncle Isaac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to the boys, who were about to measure in the
direction that the hat was shoved into the hole.</p>

<p>“What difference does it make?” asked Bradish.</p>

<p>“’Cause it does. I’ve a right to fire in any
direction I like, at six hundred yards.”</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac fired, and the ball, just grazing the
edge of the post, went through every fold of the
hat crossways, the rifle ball whirling as it went,
cutting it all to pieces.</p>

<p>“You’ve spoilt my new hat,” said Bradish, with
a rueful face, holding it up, all full of holes, like a
colander.</p>

<p>“That’s what you get by trying to cheat: good
enough for you,” was the cry.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the laugh subsided, when Will
Griffin was seen coming on horseback at full
speed, and as he drew near, he bawled out, “Uncle
Isaac, Joe, Master Bell, Captain Rhines wants
you to come just as quick as you can; there’s a
vessel cast away&mdash;folks going to be drowned on
the Brant rocks.”</p>

<p>When they reached the cove, they found Captain
Rhines, in the Perseverance, her sails close
reefed and set, hatches fastened down, and the
vessel hauled in against a perpendicular ledge,
while he was holding her by a rope fast to a tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jump aboard!” he cried. “There’s people on
a raft, coming right in before the wind and sea, and
they will go right into the breakers on the Brant
rocks, except we can get them off. I happened
to be looking with the glass, and saw them.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do what men can do,” said Uncle Isaac.
“Hadn’t we better call at the island, and get Ben?
It’s right on our road.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good thought. Wonder I didn’t think
of it.”</p>

<p>Ben had not noticed the raft, but he saw the
schooner coming, and knew that it must be a matter
of life and death that would bring men to the
island in such a gale. Both he and Sally met
them at the shore.</p>

<p>“I want you, my little boy,” cried Captain
Rhines, as the schooner luffed up beside the
wharf, in the still water of Elm Island harbor.
“There’s a raft coming before the wind and sea,
with people on it, and a signal of distress flying.
It’s breaking thirty feet high on the Brant rocks,
and they will soon be in that surf, unless we take
them off.”</p>

<p>No more was said. Ben jumped aboard, and
the schooner, close hauled, stood boldly out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that tremendous sea. The men all commenced to
lash themselves. Charlie was forward. He had
made the end of a rope fast to the foremast, and
put it around his waist; but, before he could
secure the other end, she shipped a sea over the
bows, that filled her all full, and bore Charlie before
it like a feather. In another instant it would
have taken him overboard, when nothing could
have saved him; but Joe caught him as he was
going over the rail.</p>

<p>“A miss is as good as a mile,” said Captain
Rhines. “She shakes off the water like a Newfoundland
dog. Ben, take the axe, and knock off
the waist boards, and then the sea can have a fair
chance to get out as fast as it comes in.”</p>

<p>They were now nearing the raft, as it came rapidly
down before the sea, while the crew of the
schooner were endeavoring to cut athwart its
path. Catching glimpses of it in moments when
the raft and the schooner both chanced to be on
the top of a sea at the same instant, they perceived
that it was constructed of the yards and
smaller spars of a vessel, with an elevation amid-ships,
where an upright spar was secured by
shrouds, on which an English flag was flying. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
this elevation were dark objects, that Captain
Rhines (at home) had made out, with his glass, to
be human beings.</p>

<p>“If they are people, father,” said Ben, who,
confident to hold himself against the sea, had gone
into the bows, “they are dead; for there’s nothing
moves, only as the sea moves it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, Ben. They are lashed, chilled,
and most dead, but I’ve seen men brought to
that apparently had but a few more breaths
to draw.”</p>

<p>In a few moments Ben shouted, “There’s folks
there, four or six, I can’t tell which. I see one
move his arm a little.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” asked Captain
Rhines. “I thought there would be some one
able to take a line and make it fast, and then we
might tow them clear of the breakers and into
some lee, where we could get them off; but if
there’s nobody to take a line, we’ve got to carry
one ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Let the raft go by us,” said Ben, “and follow
it up astern with the schooner. I’ll take a
line in the canoe.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” said Joe; but Charlie insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
upon sharing the peril with his father.
They took in all but the foresail, reefed to the
smallest possible dimensions, leaving only a little
of the peak, as it was difficult to make the
schooner go slow enough to keep from running
on to the raft and knocking her to pieces; but by
luffing into the wind they managed to keep her
clear till Ben and Charlie got into the canoe, and
with a small line reached the raft, to which was
made fast a larger one, which they hauled to
them and secured.</p>

<p>There was no such thing as returning against
that sea; they must take their chance with those
they came to save. If the rope parted, or the
little vessel failed to tow her charge clear of
the surf, they were lost. During the interval
occupied in fastening to the raft, it had made
fearful progress towards the rocks, that could
now be plainly seen ahead, the sea breaking on
them in sheets of foam. Never was the clear
judgment and resolute nature of Captain Rhines
put to a severer test than now. He must carry
sail enough to drive the Perseverance through
the water with sufficient speed to clear the
rocks. On the other hand, there was danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
if he carried too much sail, of either parting the
rope, in which case Ben and Charlie, with those
they went to save, would perish, or of taking the
masts out of the schooner; and also danger of
the seas boarding her over the stern.</p>

<p>It was most fortunate for the crew of the
schooner, that when they grappled to the raft
they were a long distance off, and well over to
the edge of the breakers, consequently had to
work the raft but very little to windward. Every
time the little vessel rose on one of those tremendous
seas, when the raft was perhaps in the
hollow of another, she quivered and trembled,
and it seemed as if she must be crushed bodily
down beneath the sea.</p>

<p>“Isaac,” said the captain, who had one hand
on the rope, “I think this will bear more strain.
Unless we go ahead a little faster, we shall hardly
clear that ragged point making out to the leeward.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Benjamin, it will take the mast
out of her.”</p>

<p>“So am I, but we must risk it. There’s no other
way. It’s sartain death to go into that surf.”</p>

<p>There was one other way. A stroke of the axe
upon the “taut” rope, and the schooner, freed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
from her encumbrance, would have gone off like
a bird from the ragged reef and boiling surf,
leaving their comrades to perish; but no such
thought could find lodgment in the bosoms of
the men on board the Perseverance.</p>

<p>“Give her the sail, Isaac,” said the captain;
“it’s the only way.”</p>

<p>Beneath the increased canvas, the schooner
plunged and quivered, as though every timber
would part company.</p>

<p>They were near the breakers; the roar of the
surf was terrible; every time the great wave
rolled back, the black, ragged points of the rock
could be seen for a moment. It was now but a
couple of gunshots from them, and they were in
the outer edge of the breaker. Not a word was
spoken. Captain Rhines coolly eyed the surf,
while he managed the helm with consummate skill.
Slowly the noble little vessel drew along by the
reef, but the raft was the length of the hawser
farther in.</p>

<p>“If that sea breaks on them, they are gone,”
cried Captain Rhines, as a huge wall of water,
thirty feet in height, came sweeping along, its
overhanging edge white with foam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Ben and Charlie each seized one edge of
the canoe, evidently hoping, that though full
of water, its buoyancy might support and aid
them in swimming; but the wave broke just
before it reached them, lifting the raft almost
on end, flooding it with spray, buried them to
their necks in water, and almost tore them from
the raft, to which they clung by the shrouds of
the upright spar, while the canoe was swept
away. So near were they to the reef, that one
end of the wave broke upon the rock, and the raft
was covered with kelp torn from it by the force
of the sea. While they were yet in the very edge
of the broken water, the foremast breaking off
four or five feet above deck, went over the bows.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” exclaimed Captain Rhines; “had
it gone three minutes sooner, we had all been
lost.”</p>

<p>Drifting along before the wind and sea, they
gradually came into smoother water, when Ben,
flinging himself overboard, swam to the schooner.
With his aid they raised the broken spar, lashed
it to the stump, and contrived to spread a portion
of the sail.</p>

<p>“Ben,” asked his father, “what have you got on
the raft? Are they dead or alive?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s four of them, father; one a black man,
the cook or steward, for his hands are soft, a
sailor, a boy fifteen or sixteen, and a young man,
I should judge about twenty, who, I think, was
mate of the vessel, by his dress. They have got
just the breath of life in them; starved with cold
and hunger, and nothing but skin and bones. I
thought that sea would have killed them, but they
are alive yet.”</p>

<p>“God help them, but we can’t get to the island,
or my cove, with this broken spar. We must run
for Charlie’s.”</p>

<p>“Let us run under the lee of Smutty Nose,”
said Ben, “get rid of this raft, and take the bodies
on board, then we can go faster, else they will be
dead before we get there.”</p>

<p>They luffed up under the island in smooth water,
took Charlie on board, the dead and the living,
and permitting the raft to go adrift, made all the
sail they could spread for Pleasant Cove. They
carried the nearly lifeless bodies into the cuddy,
put them in berths, and covered them with
clothes. There were flint, steel, and tinder aboard,
but no wood. They took the bottom boards out
of a berth and split them up to kindle, and Ben<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
cut up the handspikes, which were white oak, and
split up the windlass.</p>

<p>“Father,” said Charlie, “I’ll make a new and
better one.”</p>

<p>With this supply they soon had the little place
warm enough. When they reached the cove they
found John Rhines there. He had been away, and
arriving home just after the party set out, had
kept watch of their movements. It was twelve
o’clock at night when they landed. The gale was
over, the clouds had disappeared, and a clear
moonlight made it nearly as light as day. The
wet clothing was instantly stripped from the
chilled limbs of the seamen; they were put into
warm blankets, and hot applications made. So
affecting was the sight of these living skeletons
that Mary burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Poor creatures! What they must have suffered!”
she exclaimed. “They will die; they are
as good as dead now.”</p>

<p>“No, they ain’t,” replied the captain, who had
been putting cold water down their throats with
a spoon, and found that they swallowed. “Kill a
chicken, Charlie; we’ll give them some broth by
and by; too much would kill them as dead as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
stone. Now, Mary, a little supper or breakfast,
whichever you call it, wouldn’t hurt the rest of us,
after all we’ve been through this day and night.”</p>

<p>The rising sun was pouring its light into the
windows, as with grateful hearts they sat down
to eat, the captain rising every few minutes to
administer a spoonful of the warm broth to his
patients. The clergyman and neighbors were
sent for, and funeral services performed. Then
the American flag was put over the coffins, and
they were borne to the grave.</p>

<p>“I wish we could have saved them,” said the
captain; “but we will do all we can&mdash;give them
Christian burial.”</p>

<p>Charlie and Uncle Isaac made the coffins for the
two who died, and Captain Rhines and John
dug their graves. On the eastern side of the cove
a perpendicular cliff rose abruptly from the soil,
with a little strip of green turf between it and
the beach. Here they were buried. The white
man had the name of “J. Watts” tattooed on his
right arm; the name of the black was afterwards
ascertained to be John Davis, and Charlie cut the
names into the cliff&mdash;a most enduring memorial.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">A GLAD SURPRISE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IN the course of three hours, it was evident
that both of the rescued persons were reviving
fast. Though unable to speak, they swallowed
eagerly all that Captain Rhines thought proper to
give; the expression returned to their eyes and
features, and their limbs twitched with convulsive
starts.</p>

<p>“Charlie,” said the captain, “I’ll take these
people home in the schooner.”</p>

<p>“Leave them here, we can take care of them;
and leave the schooner too. I’ll make a new mast
and windlass for her.”</p>

<p>“It is too much for Mary, with a young child,&mdash;two
invalids to take care of.”</p>

<p>“No, it ain’t, father; they will be all right, as
soon as it will do to let them eat and drink.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the young man, at any rate, and you
may have the boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>They wrapped him in a blanket, and he was
so emaciated that Charlie took him in his arms
as though he had been an infant, and put him
into the whale boat.</p>

<p>“Wife,” said the captain, the next morning, as
he sat watching his charge, as he lay sleeping,
after having eaten more than he had allowed
him at one time before, “do you know that since
this young man has come to himself a bit he
looks very natural to me. I’ve seen him, or some
of his folks, before.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be at all strange if you had, for
you have been a traveller all your life.”</p>

<p>“It beats all how familiar his features look;
and the more I look at him, the more the likeness
grows upon me. He’s the very image of
somebody I’ve known and loved right well, but
to save me, I can’t tell who. He’ll be strong
enough to talk when he wakes, and I’ll know
who he is, and all about it. Only see, Mary, how
the color has come into his lips! they are not
drawn apart as they were. See how his eyeballs
are filled out, and his fingers; and his nose is
not so sharp as it was. He’s doing first rate.”</p>

<p>As the captain had predicted, the young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
who had been within a hair’s breadth of eternity,
awoke a few minutes before noon, extremely
weak, but free from stupor, and in partial possession
of his faculties, and inquired where he
was.</p>

<p>“You are among friends, young man, and safe;
make yourself easy. Where are you from?”</p>

<p>“Salem.”</p>

<p>“Salem! Was you born and brought up in
Salem?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Brown, sir.”</p>

<p>“What is your father’s business?”</p>

<p>“He was a shipmaster, but he is not living.”</p>

<p>“Was his name Arthur?” cried the captain,
more eagerly, his face flushing, and then becoming
very pale.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And was he cast away in the Roanoke on
Abaco, and all hands lost?”</p>

<p>“Just so, sir.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, my son,” shouted the captain,
leaping from his chair, and grasping both hands
of the seaman, while tears of gladness, streaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
from his eyes, fell thick and fast on the pale
features of his wondering guest; “your father
was one of God Almighty’s noblemen; the first
and best friend I ever had. All I am and all I’ve
got in the world I owe to him. Didn’t you never
hear him tell about Ben Rhines, the long-legged
boy just out of the woods, with pine pitch sticking
to him, that had to make his mark on the
ship’s articles, that he learned to read and write,
and made a shipmaster of?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, sir, a great many times.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m Ben Rhines, what there is left of
him. Is your mother living? and what family did
your father leave?”</p>

<p>“My mother is living in Salem. Father left
three children, two girls and myself; he also took
a nephew to bring up after his father died.”</p>

<p>“Did he leave property?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He owned a large part of the Roanoke,
and there was no insurance on her. My
mother was left poor; father wasn’t a man to lay
up money.”</p>

<p>“No, he had too large a heart. I’m glad of it.
I’ve got enough for both, thank God! I thought
I’d got enough to take me well through, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
shouldn’t try to make any more,&mdash;but I will.
I’ll just give my mind to making money. I’ll make
lots of it. I’ll go to sea again. I’ve got a glorious
use for money now. But how came you in an
English ship? Among all the friends your father
had, and the hundreds whom, to my certain knowledge,
he helped into business, was there not
one who thought enough of his obligations to
do for his son?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. After father was lost, mother kept
a boarding-house for masters and mates of vessels,
and many of his former friends boarded
with her, and set up our girls in a dry goods
store. My cousin went into a grocery store. I
was the youngest. When I left school I went on
board a ship, belonging to a friend of father’s,
as a cabin boy. He put me right along. I am
only twenty-one last July, the fourteenth. The
ship was sold in Liverpool; and by the captain’s
good word, I got a mate’s berth in an English
ship, knowing if I got across to Halifax, I could
easily get home from there. The ship sprung a
leak: the crew and second mate took the boats,
nautical instruments, and nearly all the provisions,
and left. They didn’t like the captain; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a hard man, and there had been quarrelling all
the voyage. Finally they put on their jackets (they
might have kept the ship free), and told him they
had as many friends in hell as he had, and left.
They offered to take me with them; but I thought
it my duty to stick by the captain and the ship.”</p>

<p>“But how came the cook, the seaman, and
the boy to stick by you. Why didn’t they join
the strongest party?”</p>

<p>“The black was a slave in Jamaica. The captain
took a liking to him, bought him when he
was nineteen, and gave him his liberty. He
wouldn’t leave the captain. The sailor was a
townie and shipmate of mine in the other ship;
the boy belongs in Salem, the son of one of our
neighbors, and was also with me in the other
ship, and a better boy never stepped on a vessel’s
deck. We three stuck together. Captain
Rhines, is there any way I can get a letter to
my mother, to inform her of my safety, and also
of the boy’s? She knows I was on my passage
in the Madras to Halifax, and that it is time for
the ship to arrive there, and if the crew are
picked up or get ashore they will report us as
lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“We have a mail now once a week. It will go
day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>At this period of the conversation Mrs. Rhines
came into the room, when the captain, rushing at
her, half smothered her with kisses.</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter, Benjamin?” she exclaimed,
noticing his flushed face, and the traces
of tears on it.</p>

<p>“Matter, Molly!” bursting out afresh; “the
matter is, we’ve got another boy. You know,
wife, how much you have heard me tell about Mr.
Brown, the mate of the first square-rigged vessel
I went to sea in, that did everything, and more
too, for me?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Benjamin, I guess I have.”</p>

<p>“This is his boy, lying here on this lounge!&mdash;his
only son, named for him.”</p>

<p>“How glad I am, Benjamin!&mdash;glad on your
account, and on my own, for the sake of his
mother.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, wife, when I took his father
by the hand, to bid him good by, as I was about
to step aboard the James Welch as first officer
(through and <i>only</i> through his means), I said, with
a full heart, ‘Mr. Brown, how can I ever repay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
you?’ His reply was, ‘Ben, do by other young men
you may fall in with, and who are starting in the
world with nobody to help them, as I have by
you.’ And now a kind Providence has put it in
my power to save the life of his son, so help me
God, if ever a debt was paid, principal, interest,
and <i>compound</i> interest, this shall be. Kiss him,
wife.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rhines kissed the wasted cheek of the
young man, and assured him that she was, equally
with her husband, interested in his welfare, and
rejoiced to receive him as a member of their
household.</p>

<p>“Now, Arthur,” said the captain, “you are our
boy. You are just as much at home in this house
as we are ourselves, and the more we can do for
you the better we shall like it. John, here is
your brother.”</p>

<p>This whole-souled declaration elicited no reply.
The young man, exhausted by the long and exciting
conversation, had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>“Poor boy! he is weak. Only see the great
sores on him. See what a sight of little boils are
coming out all over his arms.”</p>

<p>“That, wife, is soaking in salt water so long;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and the sores are where the ropes he was lashed
with chafed him.”</p>

<p>Utterly unable to keep the discovery confined
to himself and family any longer, he mounted his
horse, and rode full speed to tell Uncle Isaac and
Charlie. When he reached Charlie’s, he found
the boy (who was less accustomed to exposure)
had recovered strength much more slowly than
the mate. The moment he saw the captain, he
wanted to know how Mr. Brown was getting
along.</p>

<p>“You like Mr. Brown?” said the captain, after
replying to his question.</p>

<p>“<i>Like</i> him, sir! You can’t help liking him.
Every man on board liked him. The men wanted
him to go with them in the boats; but they
wouldn’t have the captain, and he thought it was
his duty to stick by him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you will want to go to sea any
more?”</p>

<p>“I shall go if Mr. Brown goes. How can I get
home, sir, when I get my strength again?”</p>

<p>“It will be some time before you will be fit to
go. When that time comes, I’ll get you home.”</p>

<p>“Could I send a letter, when I am able to
write?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Brown’s going to write to-morrow to his
folks and yours. What is your name, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Edward Gates, sir. They call me Ned on
board ship.”</p>

<p>“You are from Salem, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Mr. Brown and I live on the same
street&mdash;King Street. His house is only four
doors from mine.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ve always known him?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, sir. I went to school with him. He
was one of the big boys, and I was a little one. I
used to say my lessons to him when the master
was busy, and sometimes he kept school when the
master was sick. Sometimes, when his father’s
ship was in port, he would get her yawl boat, and
give us little fellows a sail.”</p>

<p>After the building of the Casco, Charlie had
been enabled to gratify his taste for cultivating
the soil and improving his place. The Hard-scrabble,
under the command of Seth Warren, and the
Casco, under that of Isaac Murch, had made profitable
voyages. Charlie and John found themselves
in possession both of means and leisure.
Charlie had built a large house, roomy enough to
contain his men whenever he wanted to build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
more vessels, a barn, workshop, and other out-buildings.
Hard wood stumps soon decay, white
pine will last fifty years, and oak much longer
than beech, maple or birch. The slope in front of
the house presented a most enchanting view.
Directly in front of the house was a most noble
growth of forest trees, where the birch, beech,
maple, and oak, in associate beauty, intermingled
their huge trunks, covered with moss, and of such
majestic height as to permit the buildings to be
seen between their stems. A footpath wound
among them to the outer edge, where, between
their gnarled and twisted roots, gleamed the clear
waters of Silver Spring.</p>

<p>Almost any summer or autumn morning, about
nine o’clock, you might see a gray squirrel sitting
on one of the great tree roots, viewing himself in
the transparent water, washing his face, and making
his toilet by its aid. Scattered all along on
the surface of the slope margining the beach
were clumps and single trees, of peculiar beauty
and vast size, which Charlie, by abstaining from
the use of fire, had spared; thus preserving what
it would have required seventy years, and a large
outlay, to have obtained by planting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither the mill nor the shop could be seen,
except in one direction; that is, when you were
directly in front, they were so embosomed in
foliage, Charlie having left the growth around
them, for he was in possession of ideas of taste
and beauty, of which neither Captain Rhines,
Uncle Isaac, or John had the least conception. It
was a pleasant sight, as you sailed away in the
summer, to obtain indistinct glimpses of the water
between the tree trunks as it poured off the dam,
listen to the click of the saw, and catch through
the leaves the gleams of the carpenters’ axes;
while far beyond, as the land gradually rose,
large fields of corn and grain, with their vivid
green, presented a most singular and beautiful
contrast to the black limbs and barkless trunks of
the girdled trees among which they lay, their hollow
trunks&mdash;some standing upright, others fallen&mdash;affording
a most excellent roost for the crows,
who paid their respects to Charlie’s corn when it
was in the blade.</p>

<p>At the lower edge of an immense forest of maple
and birch, from which every vestige of underbrush
had been removed, were seen the walls of a
sap camp; while, instead of a path leading to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the house, marked by spotted trees, a carriage
road had been made, so that Captain Rhines could
ride back and forth in his wagon, and Parson
Goodhue in his chaise&mdash;for he had arrived to
that dignity. It was not, however, much like the
vehicle bearing that appellation at the present
time. The wheels and arms were large enough
for a modern team wagon; the frame of the top
was made of iron; instead of leather, it was covered
with painted canvas, and on the sides were
projections, like the wings of a bird, to throw off
the mud.</p>

<p>Charlie and Joe cut a footpath through the
forest, between their farms, and put logs across
the gullies and sloughs, so that they could go
back and forth conveniently.</p>

<p>Two other notable events occurred this year.
You know Uncle Isaac was not a whit like most
elderly people, any more than chalk is like cheese.
There was nothing stereotyped about him. He
made a cider mill, to replace his white oak beam
and wooden maul. When he went to Thomaston
to see General Knox’s mills, he saw a cider press,
in which the cheese was pressed with wooden
screws. The apples, also, instead of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
pounded to pieces in a trough, with a wooden
maul, were ground between nuts, made with
grooves and projections fitting into each other,
and turned by a horse. Uncle Isaac took the
pitch of the thread of the screws, and when he
came home made press and mill.</p>

<p>Ben also, that fall, brought over to his father
and Charlie a bushel of apples apiece, which he
had raised from his young orchard.</p>

<p>“What do you think now about making cider
on Elm Island?”</p>

<p>Charlie said, “I think, when you get ready,
there will be a mill for you;” and told him what
Uncle Isaac had done.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac didn’t stop here. He made his
wife and Sally Rhines a cheese-press, with screws.
The way they pressed cheese before this was, to
put a lever under the sill of the house, place the
cheese under it, and then put rocks on the other
end of the lever. At Ben’s suggestion, he also
made a press to press hay. Before this, they carried
it loose on board vessels, and couldn’t take
any great amount, although, in Massachusetts,
presses had come in use, and Ben had seen them.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">CAPTAIN RHINES MANIFESTS HIS GRATITUDE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">NED and the mate now began to mend rapidly.
In the enjoyment of abundant food and
rest, inhaling the bracing air of autumn, and with
all the fruit they chose to eat, their sunken
cheeks filled out, the flesh covered their limbs,
their muscles assumed their wonted vigor, and
they rapidly regained all that buoyancy which
pertains to youth and high health. Mrs. Rhines,
Hannah Murch, and Mrs. Ben Rhines made them
clothes. And thus arrayed, as the evenings were
now getting of considerable length, they went
around on social visits, with Charlie and John,
among the neighbors, and over to Elm Island;
made friends, and won good opinions every day.</p>

<p>Captain Rhines, instead of manifesting any disposition
to take them to Salem in the Perseverance,
as he had promised at their arrival, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
not a word about it. Instead he seemed very
earnest in laying plans, and inventing amusements
to make them contented where they were.
One day it was a gunning excursion by water;
again hunting in the woods. At another time
he wanted them to help him about some harvesting,
which they were more than willing to do,
and seemed never so happy as when they were
doing something for their benefactor.</p>

<p>The captain’s line of conduct was a sore puzzle
to John and Charlie, and indeed to all the
family. The Perseverance must have a new mast
and windlass before she could go to Salem. But
although Charlie had made both, the captain
would not let him put them in.</p>

<p>One day Charlie, John, and Ben were together
on the island, and this fruitful subject of conjecture
came up.</p>

<p>“Ben,” said John, “what do you suppose the
reason is father don’t take Ned and Mr. Brown
home? He said, when they were first picked
up, that he would take them to Salem in the
Perseverance as soon as they were fit to go.
They are all right now, and want to see their
folks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“He seems,” said Charlie, “to have forgotten
all about it. I don’t believe he wants to take
them, for I’ve had the mast and windlass made
these three weeks, and he won’t let me put
them in.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” said Ben. “Father
ain’t like most old folks. He likes to have young
people around him. Mother says he talks hours
and hours with Brown. Perhaps he don’t like to
lose their company. If you want to know, Charlie,
why don’t you and John ask him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to.”</p>

<p>“Well, get Uncle Isaac to. He will ask in a
moment; indeed, if there’s a special reason, I’ll
warrant he knows it now.”</p>

<p>“What seems more singular to me,” said
Charlie, “is, that after telling how much he
thought of Arthur’s father and mother, how
much he was willing to do for his children, even
to cut the last piece of bread in two, that he
don’t <i>do something</i>&mdash;build him a vessel. I have
got out board and ceiling plank at the mill, and
deck plank all sawed out. It would be a capital
time now to get a frame and set her up this
fall, let her season through the winter, finish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
her in the summer, and rig her before cold
weather.”</p>

<p>“Benjamin,” said Uncle Isaac (as they shot
into a thickly wooded cove to rest their backs,
on their way home from a fowling excursion),
laying his paddle across the float, and leaning
both elbows on it, “why don’t you take these
boys home? they want to go.”</p>

<p>“Do they want to go?”</p>

<p>“To be sure. Isn’t it natural they should want
to see their parents and friends, after being at
death’s door?”</p>

<p>“But their parents know they are comfortable,
and they hear from each other every week.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t like seeing them. There’s another
thing; the boys want to build a vessel for this
young man, and so does Ben.”</p>

<p>“Ben wants to, does he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Hum.”</p>

<p>“He seems to be a nice, steady, well-informed
young man.”</p>

<p>“Is that the way it strikes you, Isaac?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The fact is, Isaac,” beginning to pick the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
leaves of a beech limb, which hung over the
float, and chew them up, “I am ready and
willing, and count it a privilege to do all I can
for this boy, and his father’s family; but whether
building a vessel, and putting him in her, is the
<i>best</i> way to do it, I am not clear.”</p>

<p>While they were engaged in this conversation,
the boat had drifted under the limbs of a birch,
that had never regained its upright position
after being bent down by the ice and snow of
the previous winter.</p>

<p>“What have you got that’s good in that red
box, Isaac?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a chicken, boiled eggs, bread, butter,
cheese, and doughnuts,” he replied, placing the
box on the middle thwart of the boat, and removing
the cover.</p>

<p>“There’s something to wash it down,” said the
captain, unrolling a jug, carefully wrapped in the
folds of his long jacket. “That’s some of the
coffee I brought home in the Ark; it’s warm,
too. We might as well eat now as any time,
for by the tide it can’t be far from noon.”</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac twisted one of the long, slender
limbs of the birch into a string, and making it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
fast to a thole-pin hole, it held the boat stationary,
while the two friends, sitting face to face
in the warm sunshine, gossipped and ate; and
having eaten nothing since three o’clock that
morning, evidently enjoyed the repast, the warm
sunshine, and the sheltered nook, so highly as to
wish to prolong the pleasure, and ate very deliberately,
till the meal was brought to an abrupt
termination by the entire consumption of the contents
of both box and jug.</p>

<p>“We were speaking, Isaac,” said the captain,
“about this young man, and about building him
a vessel. If I was able to build him one, fit her
for sea, load her, and say to him, ‘Here, my boy,
take her, and do the best you can for yourself
and me;’ and then if he made a ‘funger,’
pocket the loss, I would lay the keel to-morrow.
But in doing that, I must be concerned with
others, and risk other people’s money. Here are
Ben, Fred, John, and Charlie, all ready to strike,
only waiting for me to say the word; and Mr.
Welch would take hold in a moment if I should
say to him, ‘Here is a young man, who I think
capable, wants a vessel built.’ Now, how do I
know he is capable of taking charge of a vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and managing business in these squally times,
with the English and French pitching into our
commerce, and pirates to boot? A master of a
vessel must have grit and cool judgment&mdash;qualities
that don’t always nor often go together. He’s
very young, has been only one voyage and part of
another as mate; of course has had but little experience.
Some men make first-rate mates, but
poor masters; others poor mates, but excellent
masters. Then, if he should make a losing voyage
of it, I should feel very bad, and the rest (though
they did not say it) might feel that they had been
brought into difficulties, and lost money through
me.”</p>

<p>“He is as old, and has had as much experience
as Isaac had when he became master. You was
keen enough for putting him ahead; far more
than I was, though he is my own nephew, and has
done splendidly. This young man has had the
best of schooling, and ten times the privileges
Isaac ever had.”</p>

<p>“<i>Schooling! privileges!</i>” cried the captain;
“I wouldn’t give <i>that</i> (snapping his fingers) for
the schooling and privileges. What do they
amount to, if the man hasn’t got <i>Indian suet</i>,&mdash;hasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
got the articles in him? They <i>help</i>, but
they can’t put anything <i>into</i> a man. I knew Isaac
from the egg. I watched him as he grew up.
There’s a great deal in the <i>blood</i>. I knew the
breed he came of, both sides. He sailed with me.
I taught him, and knew him through and through,&mdash;knew
he had the root of the matter in him.
But in regard to this young man, I know only the
father. If he takes after his father in mind, as he
does in looks, he will be all right. But he may
look like the father, and take after the mother. I
don’t know anything about her or her people.”</p>

<p>“You mean to help him, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Reckon I do, if my life is spared. But I
could help him without building him a vessel, or
involving other folks. I might give him a couple
of thousand dollars in cash, and let him help himself;
or say to him, ‘Arthur, go to Salem; see if
some of your father’s friends, and the people
you’ve sailed for, won’t build you a vessel. I’ll
take an eighth or a fourth.’ I can help the
mother,&mdash;that will be my own concern, and nobody’s
business,&mdash;and I shan’t involve others, and
risk their hard earnings.”</p>

<p>“But he’s been here some time. You’ve had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
him in your house all the time, with opportunities
for talking with him, and making up your mind.
What do you think?”</p>

<p>“I think well of him. I like him all round,
think him capable, and, to tell the truth, that is
what I’ve been backing and filling for so long,
and keeping the boys back. I wanted <i>time</i> to
make up my mind, and have you and the neighbors
see and get acquainted with him, and find
what you all thought of him.”</p>

<p>“As far as my opinion is worth anything, I
shouldn’t hesitate a moment. There’s one little
thing just settles the matter in my mind.”</p>

<p>“What is that, Isaac?”</p>

<p>“Why, his sticking by that captain. Here is a
crew of men, the sweepings of Liverpool; they
take the boats, compass, and other instruments,
and shove off,&mdash;they’ve had trouble with the captain,
and are down on him, and mean to have their
revenge,&mdash;leaving him to shift for himself; the
mate they like, and offer to take him with them&mdash;even
coax him to go; they have provision, water,
and instruments, and are not overloaded. In the
boats, there’s no great risk; to remain, is almost
certain death. He is under no particular obligations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to the captain, who is an Englishman and a
stranger, yet he sticks by him, because he thinks
it his duty. If <i>that</i> ain’t pluck, principle, and
Christianity,&mdash;if that ain’t real manhood, I wonder
where you’d find it! There’s not one man in
a hundred&mdash;no, not in a thousand&mdash;<i>would</i> or
<i>could</i> have done it. And, Benjamin, ‘twill take a
great deal to make me believe that a man who has
got all <i>that</i> in him hasn’t all the other qualities
that go to make up a man.”</p>

<p>“It’s just what his father would have done.
Well, Isaac, I’ll take them to Salem. I’m acquainted
there; have an old shipmate that knew
his father. I’ll see the captain he’s been mate with,
and if they speak well of him, we’ll go ahead.”</p>

<p>“John,” said his father, on his return home,
“clap the saddle on the horse, ride over to Charlie’s,
and tell him he may get the schooner ready
as soon as he likes; and tell Fred to get his fish
and potash ready, for I’m going to Salem, and will
take a freight to Boston, and bring back any goods
he wants.”</p>

<p>Captain Folger was sitting in his store just before
noon, frequently looking at his watch, for the
demands of appetite were pressing,&mdash;he had set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
up a ship-chandler’s store, after having spent the
greater part of life at sea,&mdash;when Captain Rhines
entered, and most agreeably surprised him.</p>

<p>“Why, Captain Ben!” exclaimed the old seaman,
grasping his friend by the hand, “what good
wind has blown you hither?”</p>

<p>“I had business in Boston, and so called in here.
It’s long since we’ve met. I hardly thought you’d
know me so readily.”</p>

<p>“<i>Know</i> you! Old shipmates don’t forget each
other.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve left off going to sea, and turned
storekeeper!”</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s the most natural thing an old shipmaster
can do to turn ship-chandler, and have vessels
and rigging to look after. I couldn’t be contented
ashore in any other business. I own some
navigation, and have that to look after. My shop
is a loafing place for the old captains, and we
fight our battles over again, spin our yarns, plan
voyages, and keep each other’s spirits up. We
heard about your going to Cuba on a raft, and
it was agreed on all hands it was the smartest
thing ever done in these parts, or anywhere. You
ran a confounded risk, but they say you made
your Jack out of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I made <i>something</i>.”</p>

<p>“You knew Captain Brown, Arthur, who was
lost on Abaco?”</p>

<p>“<i>Knew</i> him! I guess I did. He was the means
of putting me into business.”</p>

<p>“He was the means of putting a great many
into business.”</p>

<p>“Do you know his son?”</p>

<p>“What, young Arthur?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. We’ve been much worried about
him. The vessel he was in foundered, but he has
been picked up, so his mother tells me.”</p>

<p>“I picked him up, and brought him here not
two hours ago. What kind of a young man is
he?”</p>

<p>“As fine a one as ever the sun shone upon; he
is thought a great deal of here, both upon his
father’s account and his own.”</p>

<p>“Is there business in him, or only goodness?”</p>

<p>“Both; as much of one as the other.”</p>

<p>“Do you know Captain Bates, who he was mate
with?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Will you introduce me to him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; he’ll be in here about two o’clock, with
half a dozen more old web feet, that you know, or
who have heard of you, and we’ll have a jolly time
of it. But come,” looking at his watch, “it is grub
time; go up to the house; you belong to me while
you are here.”</p>

<p>“I will dine with you; but I made an engagement
with young Brown to meet me here at five
o’clock, and I am to take tea with him.”</p>

<p>Captain Rhines met Captain Bates at three
o’clock, who, in reply to his questions in relation
to young Brown, replied, “If you’ve got a frigate,
give it to him.” When Arthur came, according to
appointment, Ned Gates came with him.</p>

<p>“Captain Rhines,” said Ned, “father and mother
want you to come to our house, and stop with us
while you are here.”</p>

<p>“He’s going to stay with us,” said Arthur.</p>

<p>“No, he ain’t,” said Captain Folger; “he belongs
to me. He can go to supper with Arthur,
and he can dine to-morrow with you, Ned; but we
are old shipmates, and the rest of the time he belongs
to me.”</p>

<p>Captain Rhines, while at Mrs. Brown’s, proposed
that the whole family should go down and live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with him. But Mrs. Brown, who was a capable,
energetic woman, many years younger than her
husband, would by no means consent. She told
him, in reply, that her daughters were doing well
in their store; that though her husband left her
no money, he had left the house clear of debt.
That his nephew was learning a trade, and she
was doing well keeping boarders, and could not
consent, by any means, to live upon him, as she
could not be happy in so doing; but as he had announced
his intentions of helping Arthur to a vessel,
she should feel under the greatest obligations.</p>

<p>Before leaving, he compelled her to accept a
check upon Mr. Welch for two thousand dollars,
made the girls a present of five hundred more,
and a hundred to George Ferguson, the nephew,
without which, he declared, he could not sleep
nights.</p>

<p>Having accomplished this, he felt quite satisfied
and happy; and began to talk with Arthur in relation
to the intended vessel.</p>

<p>“What kind of a vessel do you want, Arthur,
and what trade do you want to go into?”</p>

<p>“I should prefer, sir, always with submission
to your better judgment, a sharp vessel, that will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
outsail the English cruisers, run the gantlet, and
carry provisions and supplies to France. There
will be risk, but I have an idea there will be corresponding
profit.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk, my boy,” cried the captain, delighted
with a proposal so congenial to his own
hardy and enterprising nature. “I only wish I
was young enough to go into it myself. Now, if
there’s a man in these United States that can
build a clipper that will show a clean pair of heels
to anything that swims, that man is Charles Bell.”</p>

<p>It was just after dinner, of a pleasant afternoon,
Charlie and his wife were seated in the sun, in the
barn-door, husking corn, the sharp click of a
horse’s feet that overreached was heard.</p>

<p>“That’s father,” said Mary. “I know the click
of the mare’s shoes.”</p>

<p>“Charlie!” shouted the captain, never stopping,
till the mare’s feet struck the heap of corn in the
floor, sending the kernels in Mary’s face, “grind
your broad-axe. Arthur Brown wants a vessel
that will show her heels to the English frigates,
run the blockade, and make the sweat stand on
a dolphin’s nose to keep up.”</p>

<p>“I am thankful,” cried Charlie, delighted, “that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
after so long a time I am to build something that
is not a box.”</p>

<p>“You can’t find a better model than the Hard-scrabble.”</p>

<p>“Than the Hard-scrabble?”</p>

<p>“No; she sails well when she is light, and
with a free wind in ballast, Isaac says there’s
nothing will catch her. Just give her more
depth, so she can hold on, and put the sail on her,
and I tell you she would streak it. You must
have breadth to carry sail.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll do the best I can.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">“WE WERE PUT INTO THIS WORLD TO HELP ONE ANOTHER.”</p>


<p class="drop-cap03">IT was about eight o’clock Saturday night.
Captain Rhines had sailed that morning for
Boston.</p>

<p class="pn">Mrs. Brown had finished her household business
for the day, and was seated before a bright
fire in a cosy little sitting-room, reserved for her
private use. Her children were with her, the
girls having closed the store earlier than usual,
and with the beloved and rescued son and brother
in the midst, they were talking over the exciting
events of the week.</p>

<p>“When I look back upon what has happened
for the past two or three weeks,” said the happy
mother, “it seems like a dream. There I was,
day after day, and week after week, watching
the papers, and no news of the vessel, a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
passage too. Then I got Captain Folger to write
to Halifax, and the consignee wrote that they
supposed the vessel was lost, as one of her boats,
bottom up, had been found, and a bucket that
had the vessel’s name on it. A husband and
son both buried in the ocean. It tore open the
old wounds, and they bled afresh; brought up
all the anguish of your father’s loss anew. I
felt it was more than I could bear. How I
begged and plead with my heavenly Father for
your life, Arthur, the widow’s only hope! And
some how, whenever I rose from my knees, I
felt better than when I knelt down; a feeling
as though, some how or other, the cup would
pass from me, seemed to take possession of me,
and this feeling kept me, for the most part of
the time, on my knees. I felt better and happier
there than anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, mother, when I came to be
on that raft, provisions and water all gone, the
captain raving mad and jumping overboard, my
shipmates dying one after another, that I didn’t
think of you, and that you were praying for me?
Poor little Ned and I, our throats were so dry
and parched we couldn’t speak so as to be heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
by each other above the winds and waves. I
fell into a doze, and dreamed I saw a most beautiful
grove of apple trees all in blossom, and a
great long table spread under them, covered with
piles and piles of meat, and great goblets, that held
a gallon, full of the clearest water; and you was
sitting at it, and saying, ‘Come, Arthur, this is
all for you.’ I tried so hard to move towards
you, it woke me; and I heard a shout, ‘Raft,
ahoy! Is there anybody can take a line?’ Then
I knew there was help. I tried to shout, but
couldn’t. I could only raise my arm. Soon I
heard something strike the raft; a voice shouted,
‘All fast!’ and two men stood over us. They
were Mr. Ben Rhines and Charlie Bell. They told
me to keep my heart up, for they would stick by
me; but I was so overcome I fainted away.”</p>

<p>“Brother,” said Ellen, “didn’t you suffer terribly
before you got so low as that?”</p>

<p>“Tongue can’t describe it; but the thirst was
the worst. But here I am now, sitting before
this comfortable fire, in this old room where we
have spent so many happy hours, with you all
around me. I’m sure, as mother says, it seems
like a dream to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope,” said the widow, “such trials and
such mercies will make us better; they certainly
should.”</p>

<p>“I feel that it has been good for me,” said
Eliza. “I thought, when we were in that agony
of uncertainty, ‘O that I, too, could pray with
mother! that I had a right to, as I felt she had!
But when Captain Rhines’s letter came, I did go
to God with tears of thankfulness, and trust I
was accepted.”</p>

<p>“I thought, if my poor boy’s life could only be
spared, even if he was a cripple, or injured for
life, I could ask no more. And then to have
him come home so well and happy, with such
a friend as God has raised up for us all in Captain
Rhines! Yet I can never think upon him
and his kindness but it makes me reflect upon
myself.”</p>

<p>“Why so, mother?” said Arthur.</p>

<p>“Your father was of most open and generous
nature, far too much so for his own interest,
and, as I then thought, for that of his family,
while my disposition was very different. My
parents were poor, and I was brought up by a
relative, early taught hardship, knew the value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of money, and was naturally prudent. Your
father would take the clothes off his back to put
on anybody else. I used to go to sea with him,
when we were first married; and when sailors
came on board without clothes, he would give
them clothing, fix them all up, and make them
comfortable. I used to tell him, sometimes, that if
they drank, gambled, and threw all their money
away, they ought to suffer the consequences, and
his first duty was to his family. But it was no
use to reason with him; he couldn’t help it&mdash;couldn’t
bear to see anybody suffer; and at length
I refrained from saying anything on the subject,
but tried to economize all I could, to offset his liberality.
He never concerned himself about household
matters, was gone a great part of the time,
and left everything to me.</p>

<p>“He would come home, and bring barrels of
sugar and molasses for family use, and bags of
coffee, and have them hauled up to the house;
and also quantities of fine cloths from Europe and
the East Indies for me and the children, and material
for towels, curtains, and bedding. After he
was gone, I would live as prudently as possible,
sell a great part of the things sent home, and put
by the money against time of need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“After our third child was born, he began to
alter gradually, and seemed to have different
ideas, became more prudent, and, as he was a
man of great business talent, began to accumulate,
and soon owned a good part of the vessel, and,
had he lived, would have become a wealthy man,
but was taken away in a moment. There was no
insurance on the ship or cargo, and all he had
accumulated was gone, except this house. Then,
being left a widow, with a young family, I found
the benefit of the little I had saved.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure, mother,” said Eliza, “I don’t see
what you have to reflect on, except with satisfaction.
You were not saving for yourself, but for
us children, and for father, had he lived to be old,
and past labor.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I was so anxious that your father
should lay up something for his family, that after
he was gone, I felt that perhaps I had said more
than I ought; sometimes, too, I would discourage
him from doing for others, when it did not consist
in giving money; when he would spend a great
deal of time at sea in teaching some young man
navigation, when, as I thought, he ought to have
been asleep in his berth, or resting; often, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
he was on shore, and I wanted him to go with me,
he would be running here and there, night and day,
to get a vessel built for somebody, and oftentimes
get small thanks for it, as I told him. Then he
would say, ‘Harriet, we were put into this world
to help each other; we ought not to feel vexed or
disappointed if we do not always receive gratitude
from those we have befriended, when we
consider how ungrateful we are ourselves to our
Maker, but do our duty.’ These things often
came up in memory, after he was taken away, and
I would have given anything if I had not said
some things, and could have taken them back.”</p>

<p>“But, mother,” said Ellen, “I don’t think you
ought to feel so. You meant it for his good.”</p>

<p>“I thought I did, at the time; but since then I
have felt there was a good deal of selfishness at
the bottom, that ought not to have been there;
that your father felt it, and it pained him, for I
could see a shade of sadness flit across his face,
like a cloud across the sun in a spring morning.”</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, mother,” said Arthur, putting his
arm around her, and wiping away the tear that
trembled on her cheek.</p>

<p>“But when,” she continued, in a voice broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
with emotion, “in the midst of my anguish about
you, that letter came from Pleasant Cove, telling
me your life had been saved by Captain Rhines
(one of the very boys your father had worked so
hard to help), so full of sentiments of affection for
your father, and gratitude for the favors he had
received from him, and a few days later your
letter, telling me of their kindness to you and
Ned, I was overcome.”</p>

<p>“O, mother, I can’t tell you one half they did
for me, because it can’t be told; for it was not
only what they did, but the way they did it. It
came so right out of the heart. They seemed to
love to do it, and it was done with such looks and
tones of love.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and when that noble man came up here,
and couldn’t do enough&mdash;wanted to take us all
home with him&mdash;insisting upon it, didn’t I feel
condemned for trying to hinder your father from
helping others, and telling him he got small thanks
for it? Here, now, is one of those very persons,
becoming a father to his son, putting him right
into business at once.”</p>

<p>“Well, mother, I’ve made up my mind to one
thing&mdash;I’ll try to show myself my father’s son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and practise that which I approve of so much in
others. I’ll let Captain Rhines, Mr. Ben, Charlie,
John, and the others see that I am not deficient in
gratitude. If God gives me life and strength, the
grass shan’t grow on that vessel’s bottom. I’ll
make her a happy vessel for sailors, and help
every young man I can, as father told Captain
Rhines to do when he asked him how he could
repay him. And as he has helped me, whether I
get any thanks for it or not, I’ll look higher than
that for my reward,&mdash;I’ll get it in doing my duty.
I’ll begin with my shipmate, little Ned Gates.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you talk thus, Arthur.
Your father’s principle was the true one,&mdash;do
right because it is right,&mdash;and from all I have
seen, it generally bears the best fruit even in this
life. There was your uncle David, just the opposite
of your father; always saving for his children;
so close as to be on the edge of dishonesty,
if not actually dishonest; never had a thought or
care for any one but himself or his own, and, just
as he had amassed a large property, went into a
great speculation in his old age for the sake of getting
more, when he had more than enough already
risked the whole, and lost the whole. Now, worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
out, and broken down, without a house over his
head, everybody says, ‘Served him right,’ and his
children all poor, while your father’s good name
and deeds have been money at interest for his
family, and the bread he cast upon the waters has
come back after many days.”</p>

<p>“Mother, there’s one thing I want you to do before
I go to sea.”</p>

<p>“What is that, Arthur?”</p>

<p>“Just send off these boarders,&mdash;no longer
make a slave of yourself,&mdash;and take some comfort.
The girls are doing well in the store;
George supports himself; I am going to have
business, and Captain Rhines has given you and
the girls money; so there’s no need of working,
and wearing your life out now.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t feel right, Arthur, if I were not
earning something; a thousand dollars would soon
be spent, come to sit down and live upon it; you
may have hard luck at sea; the girls are doing
well, to be sure, but they have got to return the
money that friends loaned them to start with. I
have put that thousand dollars in the bank, against
a rainy day; besides, I have another reason for
wishing to earn something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ellen.</p>

<p>“I want to atone for past selfishness, and follow
your father’s example in doing what little I can to
help those poorer than myself. It’s but little I
can do, to be sure, but I mean to do that little
cheerfully, and I trust ‘twill be accepted. There
is the mother of poor James Watts, who was on
the raft, and died. She is poor, and bereft of all
her dependence, for he was a good boy, and gave
her all his earnings, while my child was spared,
and friends raised up to help me; and I mean to
do all I can to help and comfort her. I mean to
act on your father’s principle, ‘Harriet, we were
put into this world to help each other.’”</p>

<p>“At any rate, mother, you need not have so
large a family and work so hard; you can keep
more help; you must gratify me in that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will, my son.”</p>

<p>At this period of the conversation, the servant
announced that a young man wanted to see
Arthur.</p>

<p>“It is Ned; tell him to come in here. Good
evening, Edward; sit down beside me; this is more
comfortable than the raft.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose you hardly care to sail salt water
any more, you’ve had such bad luck this time.”</p>

<p>“O, yes, sir; old Captain Osborne tells me some
people have all their bad luck at once, and that
it’s a good sign when a man falls overboard before
the vessel leaves the wharf, or is wrecked at the
first going off. He says that ship was cursed.”</p>

<p>“Was cursed!” said Mrs. Brown; “what did he
mean by that?”</p>

<p>“He says, marm, that he knew that captain; that
he was a cruel man to sailors, abused and starved
them (that I know to be true); that it was thought
he had murdered men. Are you going again, Mr.
Brown?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Edward. Captain Rhines and his folks
are building me a vessel; I expect the keel is
laid by this time.”</p>

<p>“Can I go with you, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if your parents are willing.”</p>

<p>“They are willing I should go with <i>you</i>, sir.”</p>

<p>“It will be some months before the vessel is
ready; now, you better go to school, and get all
the learning you can.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; shall I study navigation?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ll teach you that on board ship. Study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
arithmetic and book-keeping, learn to keep accounts
and write a business hand, and study trigonometry
and geography. If we live to get to
sea in the ship, we won’t starve, or abuse anybody,
nor pass any wrecks, and try not to have the
vessel cursed. We know what it is, my boy, to
starve, and to be helped in distress, and will do
as we have been done by.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brown, don’t you think the folks at Pleasant
Cove and round there are the best folks that
could be?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ned.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you think Charlie is handsome,&mdash;the
handsomest man that ever was?”</p>

<p>“I think Captain Rhines is handsome.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but Charlie Bell; is it any hurt for
me to call him Charlie? They all down there call
each other so, and somehow I seem to love him
more when I don’t put the handle on.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed; do you love me better when you
don’t put on the handle?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; because I have been used to calling
you Mr. Brown, and it comes natural, and I
couldn’t love you any better than I do.”</p>

<p>“I suppose, Ned, Charlie looks handsome to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
you, and Captain Rhines to me, because we had
the most to do with them; but they are both
really fine-looking men. Most people would think
John Rhines a finer specimen of a man than
Charlie. I have seen a great many men, but I
never in all my life saw so fine a proportioned
young man as John Rhines; if he lives, he’ll
be almost as strong as Ben. Charlie is the handsomest,
John the most manly.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, do you know what I thought (I suppose
I was wandering) after they took us off the raft, and
I kind of came to? I opened my eyes, and Charlie
was bending over the bed. I looked him right in
the face; such a beautiful face, so much goodness in
it, I thought I had got to heaven, and that an angel
was hovering over me; and then, when I came
to myself, he was so kind,&mdash;fed me with a spoon,
took me in his arms, and put me in a chair, just as
my mother would; and Ben Rhines, though he
ain’t handsome, he is just as good as the rest.
Uncle Isaac and Fred Williams, they are all just as
good as they can be. I mean to go down there,
and stay a month at Pleasant Cove, and Elm
Island. They asked me to.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE YOUNG CAPTAIN UNDER FIRE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">THE day is breaking. A vessel of two hundred
and fifty tons lies completely enveloped
in a dense, damp fog, and becalmed, off the
coast of France, in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>It is impossible to discern an object twice the
length of the vessel. Let us go alongside, and
see if we can arrive at any conclusion respecting
her character and business. She is evidently of
American build, though she shows no colors; but
spreading a cloud of canvas, modelled and rigged
entirely with reference to speed, and though unarmed,
with a much larger crew than would be
required in the ordinary pursuits of commerce.
The appearance of the crew as to dress is quite
in contrast to that of a ship’s crew at the present
time, for during the last forty years there has
been a gradual change in the clothing of seafaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
men, rendering it not only more comfortable,
but much lighter.</p>

<p>At that time, sailors wore, for head covering,
tarpaulins. These were generally made by the
men themselves at leisure moments on board
ship. The process was this: as the course of
trade in those days was chiefly to the West
Indies, they procured the leaves of the dwarf
palm, which they split into proper widths and
platted, making the button, in the middle of the
crown, of the same material, though some, as a
matter of fancy, took the lead tags that came on
bolts of canvas, and some a piece of money, and
punching holes in the rim, began their work on
that. After the braid was made, it was sewed
together with ravellings of duck; then, if there
was a pig killed on board, or a porpoise harpooned,
they soaked the hat in the blood and
let it dry, to make it stiff (this was sailors’ paste),
then covered it with canvas, then mixed tar,
grease, and salt water together, and daubed it
with the composition to render it water-proof;
but after a while they found that black paint
was just as good, and much lighter. Then tarpaulins
gave way to peaked red caps, Scotch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
caps, and finally the present dress was adopted.
But the crew of the brigantine wore tarpaulins
of still more ancient dates, and of enormous
weight, made by covering thick wool hats with
tar and canvas. The dress of landsmen at that
time was breeches and long hose, but sailors
wore trousers very wide at the bottom of the
legs, the rule for the width, being the length of
the foot; on their feet, for dress-up to go ashore,
slippers that showed the joint of the great toe.
Sheath knives were not worn, except occasionally
by some Spanish sailor; they used large,
square-pointed jack-knives of English manufacture,
slung to the neck by a lanyard. The officers,
both captain and mate, wore at sea short
jackets. If a mate then had worn a long-tail
coat, the sailors would have cut the tails off with
their jack-knives. Every one of the ship’s company
wore his hair in a cue, which was wound,
when at sea, with an eel-skin, but with a ribbon
when going ashore, and hung down the back.
When at work it was frequently coiled around
the top of the head and covered with the hat.
Men prided themselves on the length of their cue,
and in their watch below, watchmates combed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
out and tied up each other’s cues, and the cook
or steward took care of the captain’s.</p>

<p>She looks, for all the world, like a slaver. The
use of copper on the bottom of vessels was scarcely
known then, and as she rolls to windward,
little spots of grease are seen floating on the
water, and we perceive that her bottom is
covered with a coat of tallow and soap, to increase
her speed to the utmost.</p>

<p>There is something in the appearance of the
man who is climbing the main rigging that seems
familiar. Looking more closely, we are delighted
to recognize our old acquaintance Walter Griffin,
now growing into a lithe, fine-looking young man.
He is acting as second mate, that officer being
sick with a carbuncle on the back of his neck,
the pain of which made him nearly frantic.</p>

<p>Walter was remarkably keen of sight and quick
of hearing, and therefore went aloft as lookout, instead
of a sailor. Although there was no possibility
of discerning anything from the deck at any
considerable distance, yet as the fog hung low, it
was somewhat clearer aloft. There was also a
probability that the fog might scale when the sun
rose, or a breeze springing up sweep it away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>There is evidently great anxiety among the
ship’s company to gain intelligence, for all hands
are on deck, the men clustered as thick as bees
on the forecastle. The mate, a stranger, paces
the quarter-deck. As Walter goes aloft aft, and
another man forward, he cautions them, if they
see or hear anything, not to hail the deck, but
make a signal. A real racer, and no mistake, this
craft. Lashed to the bulwarks are huge sweeps,
with which the numerous crew (for they are
evidently picked men of large proportions) can
move her with considerable speed in a calm.
But what is she? Some slaver from the French
islands, built in Baltimore, and trying to get
home? But how comes Walter Griffin there?
To increase our surprise, as we look at the men
grouped together on the forecastle, we recognize,
seated on the heel of the bowsprit, our old friend
Peterson, the largest man of the crew, and just
behind him his son, who is fast emulating the
massive proportions of his sire; but the usually
cheerful face of the black was clouded with
anxiety. On the end of the windlass, with one
arm flung over the bitt, sits Sydney Chase, on
the shank of the best bower anchor George Warren,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a brother of Seth; and leaning against the
stock of the anchor, in whispered conversation
with him, is another old acquaintance, Danforth
Eaton, recalling Elm Island, with all its home-like
associations and interests. We almost expect
to see Uncle Isaac and Captain Rhines
make their appearance next. Between the knight-heads
is Enoch Hadlock, a brother of Sally
Rhines. The rest of the crew are Pettigrews,
Godsoes, Merrithews, Lancasters, Warrens, Athertons,
and Elwells, all belonging to Rhinesville,
Pleasant Cove, or thereabouts. While thus perplexed,
we gaze, seeking for some clew to guide
us and unravel the mystery, the vessel, having
no steerage-way, swings lazily round in the tide,
presenting her stern to full view, where we read
“Arthur Brown, Pleasant Cove,” and recognize in
the boy sitting on the foretop-gallant-yard, little
Ned, and the next moment the manly, handsome
face of Arthur Brown appears in the companion
way.</p>

<p>It is all out now. Charlie has ground his broad-axe
to some purpose. This is the vessel built
by the Hard-scrabble boys and Captain Rhines
for Arthur Brown, the noble offering of a manly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
grateful heart, repaying to the son the debt
incurred to the deceased parent, and bearing on
her stern the name of him whose body sleeps
beneath the waves that wash the cliffs of Abaco.
What a contrast to the Hard-scrabble! what
a testimony of the energy and progressive ideas
of her builders! She is a model of symmetry
and beauty; yet you can plainly see the lines
of the West Wind, of famous memory. Charlie
has put his whole soul in her; give her wind,
she has evidently little to fear from the clumping
British men-of-war.</p>

<p>But there is not a breath of wind; she lies
helpless off the port of Marseilles, which the
English are blockading, deeply laden with a
cargo, every article of which is contraband of
war.</p>

<p>It is the period when, after the outbreak of
the French revolution, England had declared
war against France, and, supreme at sea, was
capturing the French West Indies, and blockading
their home ports. The great majority of
the people in this country, especially all the mercantile
portion of the community, sympathized
with France; they cherished a feeling of gratitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to her as our ally in the war of the revolution,
a bitter hatred against England, growing
out of the right of search, which she exercised in
the impressment of seamen, which eventually led
to the war of 1812.</p>

<p>It was all the government could do, aided by
the great personal influence of Washington, to
restrain the country from entering into alliance
with France against England, and coming to
open hostilities. In this state of things, sharp
vessels, manned by resolute men, conducted by
skilful pilots, influenced by motives of friendship
and self-interest on one side, and a bitter sense
of oppression on the other, broke the blockade
which Great Britain (whose fleets were scattered
over a vast extent of ocean) attempted to maintain
in respect to the French coasts and West
Indies, and supplied them with both arms and
provisions.</p>

<p>This is the errand of the Arthur Brown to
run the blockade of Marseilles, and accounts for
the feeling of anxiety evident upon the faces
of both officers and crew, since their fortunes
are alike at stake, as each one, in lieu of wages,
receives a share in the profits of the voyage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and if captured breaking the blockade both ship
and cargo would be confiscated. There was
also another and more terrible cause for anxiety&mdash;the
dread of impressment. The commanders of
English ships were accustomed to take men by
force from American vessels, claiming them as
British, disregarding the custom-house protection,
which declared them to be American citizens,
sometimes even tearing them up, and they
were dragged away to spend their lives in the
British fleets. A terrible instance is on record,
illustrating the dread which in the minds of
seamen was connected with impressment. A
fine, stalwart, young American seaman, being
about to be taken by force from an American
merchantman, under pretence that he was an
Englishman, seeing no way of escape from a
bondage worse than death, clasped the boarding
officer in his arms and leaped overboard with
him, when both sank, to rise no more till the
great day of account.</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour, in obedience to a
signal from Walter, a man ascended the rigging,
and, coming down, reported that Griffin was sure
he heard a rooster crow, and also the sound of
oars in a rowlock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The tide, which was at the flood, had drifted the
vessel to the neighborhood of a large rock, that
was dimly seen through the fog. The captain
called Peterson aft. “What rock is that, Peterson?”
The black gave him the French name, and
pointed it out to him on the chart.</p>

<p>“Then we are right in with the land?”</p>

<p>“Yes, massa cap’n; there’s another one inside
this, right abreast the harbor.”</p>

<p>Peterson, who was getting somewhat in years,
having broken off his intemperate habits, and obtaining
good and constant employment at home, had
given up all thoughts of ever again going to sea;
but Captain Rhines persuaded him to go in the
“Arthur Brown” as pilot and interpreter. Peterson’s
parents were Guinea negroes; but the boy was
born in Martinique, where his parents were slaves,
and was sold, when a child, to the master of a vessel
that traded to Marseilles, during which time
he became perfectly acquainted with the harbor.
The French captain finally sold him to Captain
Hadlock, the father of Sally Rhines, who sold him
to Peterson, with whom he remained till slavery
was abolished in New England.</p>

<p>Captain Rhines had frequently availed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of his knowledge as pilot, well knew his worth and
reliability, and therefore insisted upon his going
with Arthur Brown. No other person on board
could speak a word of French, except Walter Griffin,
and he not fluently, as he had learned it but
a short time before, but was daily improving by
conversation with Peterson.</p>

<p>There was now a signal from the foremast,
Ned Gates reporting that he heard blows as of a
hammer on iron; and while all hands were anxiously
listening, the sound of a boatswain’s whistle
was faintly audible.</p>

<p>“Man the sweeps,” cried the captain, running
to the compass to note the quarter from which the
sound came. Taking the helm himself, while the
whole ship’s company applied their force to the
sweeps, he steered in a direction opposite to that
from which the sound that had so alarmed them
proceeded. An hour thus passed without any
repetition of the sounds, when the fog suddenly
lifted, the sun broke out, and they found themselves
almost within range of an English frigate
on the port bow, while a sloop of war lay some
miles off on the other quarter. The crew redoubled
their efforts at the oars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s no use, boys,” said the mate; “you might
as well put on your jackets; the frigate is getting
out her boats; they’ll be alongside of us before
we can sweep half a mile.”</p>

<p>“Sweep away, men,” cried the young captain,
who was coolly watching the clouds; “something
may yet turn up in our favor.”</p>

<p>The man-o’-war’s-men, well aware of the character
of the chase by the efforts put forth to
escape, and anticipating a rich prize, strained
every nerve, coming down upon their helpless
victim with the speed of an arrow. The sound
of the oars in the rowlocks could now be distinctly
heard as the two leading boats diverged,
one making for the fore and the other for the
main chains of the “Arthur.”</p>

<p>An expression of bitter anguish passed over
the face of Arthur, as he felt that all his fair
prospects, the hopes of Captain Rhines and
others who had so nobly stepped forth to aid
and start him in life, were to be blighted in
the bud.</p>

<p>The boats were now close aboard, and the bowmen
stood up to grapple the prize.</p>

<p>“Pull, men, for your lives!” shouted the captain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
whose eye caught the sails; “there’s a breeze
coming; <i>her length</i>, only her <i>length</i> ahead.”</p>

<p>They exerted themselves to the utmost, while,
in pure recklessness, Peterson burst into a song
used by whalemen when towing a whale.</p>

<p>Despite their efforts, the foremost boat gained
the quarter, and flung a grappling; it caught.
Just then a light air filled the loftier sails, although
there was not a breath of wind on deck.
Slight as it was, it was sufficient to shoot the
swift craft ahead with accelerated speed, leaving
one boat far astern, towing and well nigh
upsetting the other. A sharp axe in the hand
of Peterson descended upon the grappling warp,
and the boat was left astern, as the increasing
breeze filled, partially, the larger sails of the
“Arthur.”</p>

<p>A broadside burst from the side of the frigate;
but the shot all fell far short, covering the water
with foam.</p>

<p>The breeze now sensibly increased. The direction
in which it sprung up brought the frigate
dead to windward.</p>

<p>“Dis be a bully grappling,” said Peterson, taking
up the now harmless implement. “Me take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
him home to Massa Rhines, to moor his boat
with.”</p>

<p>The light breeze, which propelled the swift
brigantine with considerable velocity, was scarcely
felt by the frigate; but as it gradually freshened
she began to move through the water, and
picking up her boats, crowded all sail in pursuit.
But she had, during the light wind, lost
much precious time, profiting by which the brigantine
had increased the distance between them.</p>

<p>But now the situation of things was entirely
reversed. The frigate, though no match for the
swift, sharp-built American, close-hauled on a
wind; yet dead before it, her great bulk and
vast cloud of sail rendered her superior; besides,
as she could carry sail much longer, and the wind
was every moment increasing, she would, after a
while, drown the smaller vessel out. She was
too near, at the outset, for the brigantine to haul
on the wind, and endeavor to cross her bows, as
already the shots from her guns began to fall
uncomfortably near. The wind was blowing in
squalls; when the squall struck, the frigate would
gain, and almost heave her shot on board; when
the wind slacked, the brigantine would gain.
Directly ahead lay a cluster of islands, reefs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and outlying rocks; one island was called Pomegues,
the other Rataneau. These islands are now
connected by a breakwater; then they were not.
The brow of the young captain now wore an expression
of great anxiety; he called the mate and
Peterson to his councils.</p>

<p>“We are doing all we can,” said the captain
to his subordinates, “and as the wind increases
we bury and she gains; her shot will soon be
coming aboard.”</p>

<p>“I see no way,” replied the mate, “but to
haul our sheets aft, and endeavor to cross her
bows. If we could once get him on a wind, we
could shake him off.”</p>

<p>“Then,” replied the captain, “she would run
square down on us; it is useless to attempt that.
What is your advice, pilot?” addressing himself
to the black, who was too modest to obtrude his
opinion upon his superiors.</p>

<p>“Massa cap’n,” said the black, “dis darky know
all dese rocks jes as little boy know his letters in
de book. Dis island on de starboard hand, he Rataneau;
bold water close along shore, till get down
to de pint; den he shoal, many rocks, bad place.
It low water now; we luff right round de pint
ob de island, right in among de shoals and rocks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we shall go ashore.”</p>

<p>“Nebber you fear. Dis chile carry you clear.
Dis darky know frigate no dare come in. We
drew leben feet ob water. ‘Spose he draw twenty-fibe;
he stand off good way; his shot no reach us.
Den you be on de wind, close-hauled, beat up
’twixt de islands and de main, hab smooth water;
’spose frigate he try beat up too; he no do any
ting; wid dis vessel on de wind, he nowhar.
’Spose he beat up toder side; den he hab <i>rough
water</i>; he do noting at all.”</p>

<p>There was not much time for deliberation, for,
even while they were speaking, a shot carried
away the port davit, and splintered the planks of
the stern.</p>

<p>“If that shot had struck the main boom,” said
the mate,&mdash;“and it did not lack much of it,&mdash;all
had been up with us.”</p>

<p>“You are right, pilot. Mr. Rogers, brace up
the yards.”</p>

<p>While this manœuvre was being executed, a
succession of terrible screams arose from the forward
part of the ship.</p>

<p>“Some poor fellow is struck,” cried the captain;
“run forward, Mr. Rogers, and see who it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The second mate was now heard singing out,
“Avast hauling on that fore-brace. Slack it off
handsomely.” Four or five men were at the same
time seen running up the fore-rigging.</p>

<p>In those days iron trusses to lower yards by
(which they swing in all directions as easily as a
door on its hinges) were not known; but they
were made of rope, covered with leather, and very
stiff. A man must be sent up to overhaul them
when the yards were swung.</p>

<p>Danforth Eaton went up to overhaul the weather-truss.
The wind blew the end of his cue&mdash;he
had the longest cue on board&mdash;into the hole of
the cleat; it jammed fast, and the men bracing the
yard hauled it in, pulling out the hair by the roots,
starting the skin from the flesh, and well nigh
breaking his neck.</p>

<p>“Cut the blasted thing off,” cried the sufferer
(his eyes bloodshot, and the tears streaming down
his cheeks) to Walter, who was the first to reach
him.</p>

<p>Eaton never wore another cue, and his example
was followed by a few of his shipmates; and at
length cues went out of fashion altogether.</p>

<p>The next shot fell wide; but as both vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
were now brought nearer to the wind, it was evident,
by the balls falling short, that the brigantine
was increasing the distance between them, which
became still greater as the man-of-war, afraid of
the shoals, gave the island a wider berth, while
the brigantine, under the skilful pilotage of the
black, running as near as possible to the rocks,
rounded the point of the island, gradually coming
up more and more to the wind, till, having passed
the last shoal, at a signal from Peterson, the yards
were braced sharp, the main sheet hauled flat aft,
and she shot out into a clear channel.</p>

<p>“Dere,” cried the black (who had stood on the
bow, with his eye glancing alternately from the
water to the sails), as he flung his tarpaulin upon
the deck, and wiped the sweat from his forehead,
“where dat frigate now? Dis chile no see her,”
he exclaimed, looking straight to windward.
“You ole man, Peterson, you lose de eyesight.”</p>

<p>A merry laugh went round, as the captain exclaimed,
“You are looking the wrong way, Peterson.
Look to leeward. Well done, my old pilot;
reckon on a suit of clothes for yourself, and a
dress for the old woman. I see you are all Captain
Rhines recommended you to be, and more too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Me tank you, massa cap’n; tank you, sar.
Cap’n Rhines he know dis chile well as he know
hisself; wind blow awful; big sea; take two men
hold toder man’s hair on; ship scudding; Massa
Rhines, he come on deck; ‘Mr. Strout!’ ‘Ay, ay,
sar.’ ‘Who got de helm?’ ‘Flour, sar.’ (Dey call
me Flour den.) He say, ‘Den I go below. Gib
me call, any change in de weder.’ ‘Ay, ay, sar.’”</p>

<p>“Here comes another,” said the mate, as a hundred
gun ship, aroused by the firing, stood out
from the roadstead of Marseilles.</p>

<p>“Here comes Grandfather Bull,” cried the captain,
proud of the sailing qualities of his craft.
“On a taut bowline I wouldn’t fear their whole
navy. Come along, old gentleman.”</p>

<p>The fleets of Great Britain were at this time so
fully occupied in all parts of the world, that but a
small number of vessels could be spared to blockade
the most important of the French ports, the
heavier ships lying just out of range of the forts,
and patrolling the roadstead with boats, while the
lighter vessels scoured the coast. In bad weather
they were obliged to ride it out in an open roadstead,
or run to sea&mdash;a time always improved by
the blockade-runners who were inside to get out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and by those outside, while the fleet was scattered,
to run in.</p>

<p>It was of the greatest importance for blockade-runners
to ascertain the position of the fleet in the
daytime, and, eluding the outside vessels, run by
the others in the night, taking the chance of an
attack from their boats, and a broadside. In making
the coast in thick weather, they were always
liable to find themselves, as in the present instance,
in the very jaws of the enemy.</p>

<p>Nothing but her sweeps saved the “Arthur
Brown,” by preventing the boats from boarding
her, till the breeze came. The frigate, finding the
chase was hopeless, tacked ship, and returned to
the coast; but so far were the crew of the brigantine
from relinquishing their purpose, that they
kept in sight, and the moment the twilight came
on, stood in for the land, guided by the frigate’s
lights, while all was dark on board the brigantine.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">LITTLE NED AND HIS MOTHER.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">WHEN Walter Griffin flung down the yard-stick,
and jumped over Fred Williams’s
counter for the last time, he went directly on
board the Casco, and made several voyages to
Cadiz with Isaac Murch, who valued his services
highly, and offered him promotion to remain with
him; but arriving from a voyage while the “Arthur
Brown” was building, the temptation to go
in her on shares, and engage in all the perils and
excitements attendant upon running the gauntlet
of the enemy’s cruisers, proved perfectly irresistible
to a boy of Walter’s sanguine, fearless nature;
and, as the vessel would be launched and away
before he could make another voyage and return,
he resolved to wait for her.</p>

<p>In order to make the most of his time, he went
over to Elm Island to study navigation with Lion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Ben, and then, by Captain Rhines’s advice, to
Salem, where was a French family, who, having
fled from their native country, during the revolution,
in poverty, leaving their property behind,
supported themselves by teaching French, giving
music lessons, and employing themselves in
any way which would bring the means of subsistence.
They also found no lack of sympathy
among the inhabitants, who, being a seafaring
community, not only shared in the universal good
will at that time felt towards the French, but
also were naturally touched by the miseries of
those who, having seen better days, and accustomed
to every comfort, found themselves, in old
age, poor and in a strange land.</p>

<p>Fred Williams had an uncle in Salem, a tanner.
Walter boarded with him, doing work enough in
the tan-yard to defray the expense of his board.
Thus, under the instruction of persons of culture,
and in daily contact with them, he not only obtained
a knowledge of the language, but learned
to speak it properly, and in a manner quite different
from the patois of Peterson, which, picked
up from the lower class of people, was, however,
fluent, coarse, and vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Salem, as our readers will recollect, was the
home of Ned Gates, who, ready to like anybody
who came from the neighborhood of Pleasant
Cove, received Walter with open arms, insisted
upon having him at his house to tea, and to stay
all night, about half the time, and spent every
spare moment he could get with him.</p>

<p>Ned would go down to the yard and help
Walter break bark, pull hides out of the pits,
take out the spent tan, and hang up the sides
of leather to dry, in order that his friend might
have more time to study French, and stuck to
him like his skin. Were they not going to be
shipmates together, and share in perils?</p>

<p>Ned’s parents never wanted him to go to sea,
and did all in their power to prevent it; but finding
his heart set upon it to such an extent that
he was utterly indifferent to everything else, and
unhappy, they yielded with the best grace possible.
But when he was shipwrecked, and came
so near perishing with hunger on the raft, they
were greatly encouraged, thinking it would incline
him to comply with their wishes and abandon
the sea. Ned’s mother was not only a most
affectionate parent, but a warm-hearted Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
woman. Like all Christian mothers, she had been
accustomed to hear her little boy say his prayers,
and continued the practice after he came to be
a large boy. Ned would leave the light burning,
and his mother would come up, sit by his bedside,
hear him repeat the Lord’s Prayer, then
kneel down beside the bed and pray herself.
Ned was a good boy, and loved his mother dearly,
but was full of life, and sometimes would do
something out of the way, so much so, that his
mother, after hearing him say his prayer, would
get up, take the candle in her hand as though
about to leave the room, observing, “Edward,
you have been a bad boy, to-day; I don’t know as
I ought to pray with you to-night.” This never
failed to bring Ned to terms. He would own
up, if it was any concealed mischief, confess, and
promise amendment, for he could not bear to go
to sleep till his mother had prayed with him;
yet he was nearly sixteen years old, as smart
a boy as ever went aloft to furl a royal or reeve
signal halyards. When the crew abandoned the
sinking ship, Ned, as we have before stated, preferred
to stick by the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Who says vulgarity, coarseness, and profanity
are necessary concomitants of courage?</p>

<p>“Edward,” said his mother, as he took the
candle to go to bed, the first night after getting
home from Pleasant Cove, “leave the light; I’ll
come and get it.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” said he, after saying his prayers,
“how nice it seems to be once more in the old
bed, and say my prayers to you, as I used to do!”</p>

<p>“I hope, Edward, you didn’t forget them while
you were away from me.”</p>

<p>“I never turned in a night without it; but I
didn’t have any mother to come and get the light
and kiss me when I got through.”</p>

<p>“I hope, my child, you did more than that.
I hope, when you were undergoing such misery
on that dreadful raft, you prayed to God in your
own words, and out of your own heart.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t, mother.”</p>

<p>“Not pray, when there seemed nothing but death
before you&mdash;a child instructed as you have been?”</p>

<p>“No, mother. I suppose you want me to tell
you just as it was.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my child; but didn’t the captain,
James Watts, or Arthur Brown?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“The captain was swearing part of the time,
and crying the rest. One minute he’d say he
knew some vessel would come along and take
us off, and seem quite cheerful; the next minute
he would wring his hands, and swear, and cry,
and say we should all starve to death on that
raft. After the little water and provision the
men left us was gone, he took to drinking salt
water. It made him crazy, just as Mr. Brown
told him it would, for he said he had heard his
father say so. Then he ran off on the idea that
we were going to kill and eat him. If he saw
us talking together, he would say we were plotting
to kill him and drink his blood. Mr. Brown
said the second mate told him that he passed a
crew of men once on a wreck, and wouldn’t take
any notice of their signals, though they hoisted
a signal of distress, and now he was getting his
pay for it. I suppose it was the idea he took in
his head, that we would kill and eat him, that
made him jump overboard in the night, when
we were all asleep.”</p>

<p>“That was awful; but didn’t Arthur Brown or
James Watts ever call upon God?”</p>

<p>“Not as I know of; what they did inside I don’t
know, but I never heard them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“It seems very strange to me that a boy
brought up to know and respect all good things
taught in the Catechism, and who never went to
bed a night in his life, till he went from home,
without saying his prayers, and having his mother
pray with him, should be on a raft in the ocean,
starving, death staring him in the face, and not
call upon God. I can’t understand it; I should
think that would be just the time, if ever in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Well, it ain’t, mother, though it may seem
strange to you. It seems strange to myself now;
but I suppose, if I was in the same place, I should
do just so again. I did think of my prayers, and
said them, as I told you; but whenever I thought
of doing anything more, it seemed to me so mean
to pray to God because I was in a hard place,
when I never did it when I wasn’t, that I couldn’t&mdash;I
didn’t dare to. Then I was thinking, most of
the time, about being taken off, watching for some
vessel, or dreaming and thinking about eating and
drinking.”</p>

<p>“Dreaming about eating?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, mother, that was the worst of it; when
my tongue was so swelled, as big as two tongues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and I was so weak from hunger that I could hardly
move, I’d fall into a doze, and dream that there
was a great table set full of everything that I
loved, and then wake up, and find it all a dream.
One time I dreamed I was travelling on a road in
a real hot day, and saw a little wood on the side
of a hill. I went to it, and right between two
great maple trees was a barrel sunk down in the
ground, and full of clear, cold water. It was a
boiling spring, and a flat stone right beside it.
I thought I knelt down on the stone, and looked
way down into the clear, beautiful water, saw
grains of sand rolling over and over in it, and
tried to drink; but whenever I got my parched
lips close to the water, it went away, and in my
struggles to reach it I woke; and there right before
me was poor James Watts’s dead face, and Mr
Brown looking so pale and ghostly I thought he
was dead, and I all alone on the wide ocean.
When I saw it was all a dream, I burst into tears;
after that, began to grow stupid and wandering,
and didn’t sense anything more till I found myself
in a bed, and somebody putting water in my
mouth; and don’t you think, mother, I went right
back where I left off in my dream, and thought I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was drinking out of that spring? but it was Charlie
Bell’s wife putting water in my mouth. I tell
you what it is, mother; people may think so who
don’t know; but if they were in such a place,
they would find it wasn’t a very nice time to be
good.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” replied his mother, affected to
tears by the narration, “now that God has restored
you to us, you have suffered so much, and seen
what the life of a sailor is, and what they are exposed
to, I hope you will never leave us again.
You are all the son I have got&mdash;do stay with us
and your sisters. You have had a good education;
your father will take you right into the store
with him, or he will set you up in business, when
you are old enough. There is Henry Bradshaw,
that you used to sit with in school; your old playmate;
you used to love him, and was just like a
brother with him. He is going into business
soon. You can go with him, or you can learn a
trade. Your father will send you to college&mdash;he
will do anything for you to keep you at home. If
you could only know what we underwent, after we
heard the vessel was lost, and thought you were
lost in her, and what a thanksgiving there was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the house after we got Captain Rhines’s letter,
you certainly never would leave us again.”</p>

<p>Ned was not taken by surprise, for he knew his
mother’s heart, and loved her. It was no easy
task to deny the plea of such a mother, under
such circumstances, and the very first night of
getting home, too. He lay a long time silent,
with eyes shut fast. His mother saw the tears
come out from under the closed lids, and, as she
wiped them away, began to hope her desires were
to be realized.</p>

<p>“Mother,” at length he said, “you will think I
am the worst, most hard-hearted boy that ever was
in the world.”</p>

<p>The mother trembled, but made no reply.</p>

<p>“Mother, I must go to sea. I can’t, indeed, I
can’t stay at home.”</p>

<p>“But only think what you suffered, and how
near you were to death.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t die, mother. I’m all right now,
and heavier than I ever was in my life. I was
weighed in Mr. Williams’s store the day before I
left, and weighed ten pounds more than I ever did
before, without my coat or waistcoat. Only think
of that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“But only think what you suffered!”</p>

<p>“Don’t people suffer at home, mother? Just
see what Will Webb has suffered, all tied up in
knots with rheumatism; and Tom Savage, with
the spine complaint. I do believe, if I knew I
should go through all I have been through the
next voyage, I should have to go. Ain’t I a fool,
mother?”</p>

<p>“I think you are very foolish to leave a good
home and kind parents without any necessity for
such hardships. Only think of your cousin, poor
James Ross, who fell from the main-mast and was
killed, the very first day out.”</p>

<p>“Well, mother, perhaps he would have died if
he had been at home. Captain Rhines says, when
God wants a man, he’ll call him; and anybody is
just as safe on the royal yard as on deck, or at
home in his bed. Isn’t that so, mother?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my dear; I think I should a
great deal rather have you at home in this bed.
Suppose you are sick at sea. There is no one to
take care of you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, Captain Brown and Walter will.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gates knelt down beside the bed, and
prayed for submission to bear what she felt to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a bitter trial&mdash;resigning a beloved, affectionate
boy to the hardships and chances of a life at sea.</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Ned, as she took the light in her
hand to go down stairs, “isn’t Walter Griffin a
splendid boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes; too good a boy to go to sea.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">MOONLIGHT CONVERSATION BY THE BROOK.</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">WALTER well deserved the praise lavished
upon him by Ned. He had little resemblance
to his brother Joe, or indeed any other
member of the family, except in size. He was of
large frame; Joe had great square jaws, high
cheek bones, his hair coarse and bristling, and his
joints large,&mdash;he was what is termed, in common
parlance, double-jointed,&mdash;and, though exceeding
agile, was loose-limbed, and somewhat awkward in
his movements.</p>

<p>Walter, on the other hand, was compactly
built, graceful in all his movements; fair complexion,
regular features, fine hair, that curled
upon the least exertion, and something in the
expression of his face that inspired confidence
and attracted at once; though full of humor,
he possessed not a particle of Joe’s fondness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for practical jokes. Every whit as resolute and
fond of rough sports as any of his race, he had
what none of the rest possessed&mdash;imagination
and sentiment; he was thoughtful, reflective, and
a vein of almost feminine delicacy ran through
his whole nature.</p>

<p>All that Joe thought of, when he looked upon
a noble maple, was, how much potash it would
make, whether a keel-piece could be got out
of it; or upon a majestic pine, how many boards
it would scale.</p>

<p>But Walter looked upon them with other eyes;
the murmur of the streams and the glance of
the river through the green foliage appealed
to susceptibilities that did not exist in the
breast of the other. In all other respects he
was Griffin to the backbone. He was a universal
favorite; all the boys loved Walter Griffin,
and he loved them in return. He loved John
Rhines, Fred Williams, and Uncle Isaac, but
Charlie Bell was his ideal of perfection, and,
though so much his senior, seemed nearer than
all the rest. The thoughtful tenderness of
Charlie’s nature touched an answering chord
in that of Walter; he found something there, he
could not find among his mates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Charlie, trading with Fred, and owning a portion
of the goods, was often in the store, and
brought a good deal in contact with Walter;
they naturally grew together.</p>

<p>When he found Charlie was going to be married,
he told John he was real sorry, because he
knew he shouldn’t see so much of him, and he
was afraid he wouldn’t love him so much. But
he soon found, to his great gratification, that
“the more angels in the heart, the more room.”</p>

<p>No sooner was Charlie married than he bought
a pew in the meeting-house, and asked Walter
to sit with him (as Mr. Griffin had a large family,
and their pew was always crowded), and frequently
invited him to tea; he soon began to
feel at home there, and found that he saw a
great deal more of Charlie than when he was
obliged to go on to Elm Island to see him, or
met him occasionally at the store.</p>

<p>Charlie’s religion was not something put upon
him like lacker upon metal, but it was a part
of him, as much so as the very blood in the
chambers of his heart, or the pulse in his veins;
it made him happy, and it was an instinct with
him to communicate that which so blessed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to those he loved. It was not a task; he could
not help it. ‘Twas just as much a part of his nature,
as to press the hand or kiss the lips of those
he loved.</p>

<p>The period occupied by our narrative was long
before the era of Sabbath schools, notwithstanding
young people by no means grew up, in the days of
our fathers, without religious instruction, and that
of the most substantial kind; since <i>parents then</i>
discharged, in respect to their children, the duties
which are now but too often surrendered to Sabbath
school teachers, and the material for mission
schools, now so abundant, did not then exist.</p>

<p>Parson Goodhue was accustomed, once a month,
to assemble all the children, as also the older boys
and girls, in the school-house on Saturday afternoon,
and to put them the questions contained in
the Westminster Catechism, previously committed
to memory.</p>

<p>Walter Griffin had made all his preparations for
going to sea, as a green hand, in the Casco, with
Isaac Murch; the ship was ready to sail Monday,
for Cadiz. Walter having attended the catechising
for the last time, when he saw all his schoolmates,
and received a parting blessing from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
good minister, started up to Pleasant Cove, to take
leave of Charlie, whom he met coming from the
barn, where he had been tying up his oxen.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Bell.”</p>

<p>“Good evening, Walter. I was afraid you would
go away without coming to see me.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t think of that, sir; I came up to the
school-house, and then kept on.”</p>

<p>“Then you are all dressed for Sabbath, and I
shan’t let you go from here to-night; stop right
here, and go to meeting with us in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I fear I shall hinder you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Not a whit. Uncle Isaac has been helping me
break up, and has just gone from here; we’ve done
work enough for one day. I’m going to clean up
and rest; come, go in; supper is about ready.”</p>

<p>Walter assisted Charlie to milk, and do his
chores, and as the twilight came on, they sat down
together beneath a tree near the edge of a bank,
where the brook met the waters of the bay.</p>

<p>It was a most picturesque, lovely spot, one that
Charlie dearly loved, and to which he never took
any one who he knew was incapable of appreciating
it; he didn’t like to have his chosen spots like
an unfenced common, for everybody and everything
to trample on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a warm evening, the first of September;
the season had been moist and shady; not a leaf
gave token of decay. Just above them they saw
the white foam of the water, as it fell in broken
wreaths of foam over the precipice, and caught
again the gleam of it through the leaves, as with
tranquil current it met the waters of the bay, rolling
with a low ripple upon the white sand of the
beach.</p>

<p>They sat with their backs against a large oak
that grew double, forking just above their heads,
and thus, being rather flat than round, offered a
convenient rest.</p>

<p>“Walter,” said Charlie, putting his arm around
the boy, and drawing his head on to his breast,
“how do you like this spot?”</p>

<p>“I think it is most beautiful. I could sit here
all night and listen to that waterfall, and watch the
moonbeams glancing on the water.”</p>

<p>“The first time I ever saw this place, I came
here alone, on very much such a night as this. I
loved it then, and have loved it more and more ever
since. I shall miss you very much, Walter; only
think how many Sabbath days we’ve sat side by
side in meeting; I hope there’s some good come of
it all. Walter, do you ever pray?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no reply, but a tear fell on Charlie’s
hand; at length he said, “No, sir; I never did.”</p>

<p>“But you say the Lord’s Prayer?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t your mother learn you to say it when a
child?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; there ain’t any goodness in our folks;
we are a hard, rough set; ain’t like other people;
only think about wrestling, shooting, and falling
timber. When Joe became religious, he wanted
to have prayers Sabbath night; but father wouldn’t
hear to it. Now he’s got a house of his own, he
can do as he likes.”</p>

<p>“But you are not a rough, thoughtless boy,
Walter; you are a gentle, loving boy, and you
think; all the Griffin there is in you, is on the outside;
you love the woods, flowers, the waters, and
this beautiful spot touches you, just as it does
me.”</p>

<p>Walter made no reply, but pressed Charlie’s
hand.</p>

<p>“And you love me?”</p>

<p>“I do, Mr. Bell, with all my heart and soul.”</p>

<p>“Then how can you help loving God, who made
everything and everybody that you love and admire?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know I ought.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t like to have me talk to you
in this way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I do; I could hear you talk forever.”</p>

<p>“Walter, I don’t believe there was ever a boy
in the world had more friends than you have.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I was thinking myself, this
very afternoon, when all the boys and girls came
round me at the catechising, and seemed sorry to
have me go away.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you owe a good deal to your
Maker? and ought you not to tell him so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I know I ought to; but I can’t.”</p>

<p>“You could ask me to speak to the captain, and
get you a chance to go in the Casco.”</p>

<p>“O, sir, you, Mr. Rhines, and Uncle Isaac are so
good, I don’t feel afraid to ask you anything.”</p>

<p>“God is better.”</p>

<p>“But he seems a great way off.”</p>

<p>“He would seem near if you would go to him,
and try to get acquainted. Besides, he has
spoken first, and asked you to come.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you will think I am a very rude
boy.”</p>

<p>“You are like all boys, and all the rest of us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
before we begin to think of better things. Now,
Walter, there’s just one thing I want you to do.”</p>

<p>“What is that, sir?”</p>

<p>“You know I have been on the ocean somewhat,
and know what it is to be there, and how
sailor men feel, although you will soon know much
more about the matter than I do. There is no
time, as you will soon learn, when a sailor man
spends his time so well as in the middle watch
of a pleasant night, when it is fair weather and
moderate&mdash;everything going along smooth. It
is then, if a man has any conscience, it wakes up;
if he has had good bringing up, and good instructions,
they come to his mind; it is then his
thoughts are homeward bound, and he thinks of
parents, brothers, sisters, and all he loves best on
earth. Then he travels over the whole ground,
from childhood clear along. You’ll find it so.”</p>

<p>“I expect I shall spend many an hour in that
way, and then I shall think of you and all your
kindness to me.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t kindness, Walter; it is more than that.
I have enjoyed it as much as you. There are
some beautiful nights at sea, as well as dark and
dismal ones. There will be nights just like this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
when the moon will glance on the long swell just
as it now does on the little ripple on that beach,
and the stars will seem like so many eyes looking
down upon you, and the royal will look in the
shadow as if it reached the sky.”</p>

<p>“I know I shall enjoy such nights, and wish
them longer.”</p>

<p>“They make up for a good many rough ones,
and you can live them over many times. Well,
when such a night comes, I want you, as you look
on the moon and stars, to remember that as the
same moon is shining on me, looking down on this
little brook, and into the cove, so the same good
heavenly Father is over us both; that then I shall
look at that moon, and think of you; this little
nook, the trees, and all we’ve said to one another
here will travel out on the ocean to meet you;
then perhaps you may think, I wonder if some
good friend is not thinking of and praying for me;
ought I not to do something for myself?”</p>

<p>“I thank you for all these pleasant thoughts.
I never thought of such things before. It is
not the way Parson Goodhue talks to us about
religion.”</p>

<p>“Well, he is a wise man. I can only talk in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
simple way, as it comes to me, and out of my
heart.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t talk to me like as anybody else
does. Captain Rhines often gives me good advice,
and so does Uncle Isaac, about not drinking, and
getting into bad company, or being profane, and
about saving my money. But you don’t, somehow,
seem to give me advice, or ever mention those
things. I like to have them take notice of me,
and always thank them; but when you talk <i>with</i>
me,&mdash;for you don’t seem to talk <i>at</i> me,&mdash;I want
to put my arms right round your neck.”</p>

<p>“Don’t spoil a good mind, Walter.” And the
boy actually embraced him. “People have different
ways of looking at the same thing,” continued
Charlie; “you wouldn’t want all your
friends to be just alike&mdash;would you?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, sir, any more than I would want
all the flowers to be of one form and color, or all
the birds to look alike and sing the same song.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you only love Him who made and
gave you everything half as well as you love me,
who have done, and can do, very little for you, all
these other matters will take care of themselves.”</p>

<p>“Please talk some more, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is time to go. We’ve been here a great
while. They will all be a-bed.”</p>

<p>“O, sir, we haven’t been here but a little
while.”</p>

<p>“How long do you think?”</p>

<p>“Half an hour.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been here an hour and a half; I know
by the tide. It was high water when we sat
down here. You see that white rock just breaking
the water?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, when that rock is fairly out, it is two
hours ebb. Walter, what makes you so bent upon
going to sea? You might do well on a farm.
Fred would, in the course of another year, take
you in as partner. If you want money, I will lend
it to you. Then you can be at home among your
friends. Is it because you think you can make
money faster?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I don’t think money is everything.
There’s Isaac Murch, as straightforward, kind-hearted
a fellow as ever lived,&mdash;as smart a man as
was ever wrapped up in skin; but he thinks
money is everything. He’ll give, too, especially
to a good cause; but it comes hard. He’ll go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
through a deal to get a dollar. I mean to have a
good living,&mdash;I think that’s for every one who
strives for it,&mdash;and earn my wages, wherever I
am. I don’t believe in wasting, or any of your
low stuff, but I had rather have friends who love
me for my own sake, good health, enjoy myself,
and have others enjoy themselves with me, than
all the money in the world.”</p>

<p>“Money won’t buy happiness, Walter.”</p>

<p>“You know, sir, you were saying just now that
you hoped you shouldn’t have to grind your broad-axe
again for six years; you did so long to turn
over some of this wild land, plant an orchard,
have grain, fruit and flowers, and cattle in the
pastures.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I felt more than I said.”</p>

<p>“But haven’t you made pretty much all the
property you have out of the sea?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Yet you want to work on the land.”</p>

<p>“Because I love to. I love to work with tools,
but I want some time to plant and sow, and see
things grow, whether I make anything or not; it’s
my nature.”</p>

<p>“So it’s my nature to go to sea. I wish you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
could see all the boats Flour (I mean Peterson)
has made and rigged for me. I wouldn’t care if
there was only land enough to build wharves to
tie vessels up, to clean and grave their bottoms,
and all the rest was water.”</p>

<p>“But it is a hard life, and rude company. You
are a quiet, thoughtful boy, and as affectionate as
a woman.”</p>

<p>“There’s a hard streak in all us Griffins; so I
suppose there must be in me.”</p>

<p>This was the boy Ned Gates was so much attached
to, and helped do his work at the tan-yard,
and respecting whom Mrs. Gates said he was too
good to go to sea (this good lady seeming to think
it best to have only bad men at sea).</p>

<p>Naturally adapted to sea life, he was already
(but little more than a boy) acting as second mate,
and, by his keenness of perception, was the first
to discern the whereabouts of the enemy.</p>

<p>To say that Walter and Ned were intimate, and
enjoyed themselves together, would be superfluous.
They were fortunately in the same watch,
slept in the same berth, and became more attached
to each other every day. Ned was smart and ambitious,
but light. He always aspired to furl the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
royal, which he could do well enough, when it was
dry, at any rate, by furling the yard-arms first;
but when it was wet, and a gale of wind, it was
rather more than a match for him. At such times,
Walter, who knew the ambition and grit of his
little shipmate, and was unwilling to mortify him
before the crew, would wait till he saw the sail
blow away from him once or twice, and then run
up and help him.</p>

<p>Ned was very desirous of raising a cue, and
even had dim visions of a beard. He sported a
concern about three inches in length, and which
very much resembled the appendage of a Suffolk
pig. It was so short that Walter, who combed and
dressed it for him when the rest of the watch
were asleep, found it very difficult to make the
eel-skin stay on, even with a clove hitch, and, to
Ned’s great indignation, suggested that he should
put some tar on it, in order to make the string
stick. Walter, on the other hand, boasted a cue
nearly a foot in length, and the rudiments of a
beard.</p>

<p>Whenever he shaved (which luxury he sometimes
indulged in, by the solicitations of Ned, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Sunday morning in port, when the rest were
ashore, to avoid disparaging remarks), Ned sat
looking at him with the greatest reverence, and
indulging in visions of the future, although, as yet,
his lip was guiltless even of down.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE GRIFFINS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">THOSE of our readers who are familiar with
the Elm Island stories have already known
a good deal of the Griffin family in the persons
of Joe and Henry, with a slight introduction to
Walter and Will.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, for the better understanding of
Walter’s declaration, “there’s a hard streak in
all of us Griffins,” we accompany Parson Goodhue
(who is a great friend of the Griffins, and
for whom Walter is named) in one of his parochial
visits to the homestead.</p>

<p>The good man, like most of the ministers of
that day, had a farm of eighty acres, kept a
horse, sheep, three cows, and a yoke of oxen,
and did considerable work himself, always feeding
his own cattle. He had, in addition, a wood
lot of fifty acres. The parishioners were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
habit of getting together in the fall, cutting his
year’s stock of wood, and piling it up in the
woods; when snow came they put their teams
together and hauled it to the door, when the
boys and young men assembled and cut it for
the fire; on such occasions they came about
noon, and had supper and a grand time at the
parsonage in the evening, the girls coming about
two o’clock, bringing with them abundant supplies
and preparing the repast.</p>

<p>The Griffin family consisted of eight persons&mdash;the
parents and six children, all boys, Joseph,
Henry, Walter, William, Edmund, and Winthrop.
One hot forenoon, about eleven o’clock, and just
after haying, Parson Goodhue, in all the glory
of the snow-white wig, silk stockings, and polished
silver shoe-buckles (which Lion Ben of Elm
Island had presented to him after his adventure
with the wild gander), was wending his way
by a road that skirted the bank of the river, to
Edmund Griffin’s. He was mounted on a very
finely proportioned, snug built, calico-colored mare,
a pacer. A large blue saddle-cloth protected
his garments from the hairs (as he was quite fastidious
about his dress), and he was provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with a capacious pair of saddle-bags, long experience
having convinced the good man that it
was a most proper precaution, when visiting the
Griffins, to be well provided with saddle-bags.</p>

<p>It is said, we know not with how much truth,
that dappled horses are of superior intelligence,
and can more easily be taught all kinds of tricks;
and for this reason they are often found in the
circus. However this may be, one thing is
sure&mdash;that Parson Goodhue’s mare was intelligent
enough, and vexed his soul to that extent
he sometimes feared she received diabolical aid.
But Dapple, as he called her, was such a capital
roadster, carried him so easily, and was sound in
wind and limb, that the parson, who dearly loved
a good animal, bore it patiently.</p>

<p>In those days the doors of all out-buildings
were universally fastened with wooden latches,
or buttons, as also a great proportion of the
doors of the dwellings.</p>

<p>There was not a door or gate upon the premises
of her master, or any of his neighbors, but
Dapple could and would open, a fence she could
not get over, or a pair of bars she could not
take down (unless they were pinned), provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a sufficient motive presented itself. Notwithstanding
she had been reared from a colt in
the family of a clergyman, under the very droppings
of the sanctuary, received the best of instruction,
and the best examples had been proposed
for her imitation, she would appropriate without
the least scruple; in short, though we grieve
to say it, she was a downright, incorrigible, sneaking
thief; she was no respecter of persons or
character, but would steal from saint or sinner,
rich or poor; she would even take from the
widow Hadlock and Aunt Molly Bradish (that
good old soul, when she was alive), walk right
into poor Mrs. Yelf’s cornfield right before her
eyes, because she knew that Robert was at sea,
and the old lady could not get at her for rheumatism.</p>

<p>Parson Goodhue lived so near to the meeting-house
that he and his family always walked to
meeting, thus Sabbath was a leisure day to her;
and even on that day, when all other horses
and good people were at meeting, and her good
master was inculcating morality, she would (if
she could get loose) take the opportunity to commit
trespass; in short, she was the grief of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
master and the pest of the parish, was covered
with scars she had received for her misdeeds,
and would have been killed had she belonged
to any other person than Parson Goodhue, whom
everybody loved. She would back up against
a door and turn the buttons, would lift the latch
or pull the string of one with her teeth, and
break or get off any yoke or clogs that were
put on her. The most singular part of the
whole matter was, that she would sometimes
go for a month peaceably, in the pasture, and
the good parson would feel quite encouraged,
hoping it was a radical reformation; when just
as he began to solace himself with this idea, and
accord her larger liberty, she would abuse it
to act worse than ever. At one time Dapple
had gone quietly in the pasture for nearly six
weeks, and the hopes of her master were raised
to the highest pitch. Adjoining the pasture was
a most excellent piece of wheat, just full in the
milk, belonging to Jotham Lancaster. Dapple
had not been permitted for a long time to go
out of a Sabbath day; but her conduct had been
so unexceptionable, that her master determined
to trust her, especially as there was a high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
stone wall in good repair around the pasture. So,
before going to meeting, he turned her out; when
he returned at noon, he found her quietly feeding,
and told Captain Rhines he verily believed Dapple
had got over her tricks.</p>

<p>“Hang her,” was his reply, “I wouldn’t trust
her.”</p>

<p>When the parson came home at night, there
she was, in that beautiful field of wheat. If
she had merely eaten what she wanted in one
place, it might have been borne; but she had
gone all over it, trampling down here and there,
then lain down, and rolled in half a dozen places;
and when found, was quietly feeding out in the
grass. She had, with her teeth, flung off the top
pole, pushed over the top rocks with her breast,
and then jumped over.</p>

<p>The next week John Rhines made a pair of iron
fetters, to fasten one of her hind legs to one of her
fore ones, permitting her to scuffle along and feed,
but not to jump, and made a present of them to
Mr. Goodhue, saying, “She can’t jump with these,
I know.”</p>

<p>Dapple now went quietly for some time. Captain
Rhines said to her master, “I guess you’ve got
her this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Vain delusion! she was probably meditating, in
the “recesses of a mind capacious of such things,”
upon the means and methods of evading this new device;
that her meditations bore fruit was soon manifest.
Parson Goodhue, returning from meeting
in the afternoon, found her in the midst of his own
corn. There was not a length of fence down; the
bars were all up, and pinned, so that she could not
remove them with her teeth. There was not a
stone displaced in the wall, and the fetters were fast
to her feet. As her master took down the bars to
lead her out, he gazed upon her almost with fear;
he was not superior to the superstitions of his day,
and was almost apprehensive of some satanic
agency.</p>

<p>The story got abroad; John and Fred determined
to watch her. They shut her up in the barn with
nothing to eat, till she was very hungry, then
turned her into the pasture just at night, and concealing
themselves, kept watch. Dapple went to
feeding, stopping every once in a while to look
around and listen; at length, seeing or hearing no
one, she made directly for the bars, and attempted
to take them down with her teeth; but
they were pinned at each end. She then tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
push them over by backing up against them; but
they were braced by stakes nailed to the posts, and
set in the ground; she then put her head between
the lower bar and the one next to it above, sprung
the two sufficiently to insert her shoulders, then her
whole body, and shoved herself through, coming
down whack on her side, while the bars sprung together
as before; then getting up and shaking
herself, with a look of profound satisfaction, was
making for the corn, when she was accosted in
not very flattering terms by her observers. John
said he never saw anybody look more silly, or
more worked, than she did.</p>

<p>It was a matter of great surprise to the neighbors,
and the town talk, that the mare never paid her respects
to Joe Griffin, as in the fields of all others
(except Captain Rhines’s, where Tige kept watch
and ward) she ran riot; while Joe’s (whose land
was new, just taken from the forest, and raised
splendid crops of corn and grain) were unmolested
by the common enemy; they were passed by
to commit depredations on the fields of Charlie
Bell, that adjoined.</p>

<p>We will let our readers into the mystery. The
second year after Joe worked his place, he got up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
very early one morning, just as the day broke, to go
out gunning; there was Dapple in the corn for the
first time. As Joe had recently moved into the
neighborhood, she probably, as an old resident, felt
it would be polite to call. Joe well knew the
character of his visitor, and what he might expect
in future. He, however, manifested not the least
sign of anger; didn’t even throw a stone, or hit her
with a stake; but turned her out, put up the fence,
and went off gunning; not even mentioning the
matter to his wife, who had not yet risen.</p>

<p>Dapple, who had made up her mind to receive a
pounding, thought Mr. Griffin was one of the best
of men, and resolved to cultivate his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Three nights after, she paid him another visit,
and going along the fence, found the old gap but
very indifferently mended; taking off some small
poles with her teeth, she cleared the great bottom
log at a jump; but the instant she touched the
ground on the other side, it gave way beneath her
feet, and she found herself in a pit. Bitter were
her reflections; she accused herself of imbecility
for not interpreting aright such forbearance in a
Griffin; and awaited, with fear and trembling, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
approach of morning. Just as the day broke, she
heard footsteps, and Joe made his appearance. A
smile of satisfaction passed over his face, as he
gave one look, and disappeared, returning soon
with a shovel in one hand, and a bundle of long,
tough beech withes in the other. Then, standing
on the edge of the pit, he began most unmercifully
to apply them, with all the strength and endurance
of an arm that had scarcely its rival in the community.
On head, rump, and ribs the horrible
tempest fell. In vain poor Dapple kicked, and
reared, and ran round the pit, which was not large
enough for her to get out of reach of the blows.
For an hour, without intermission, this terrible
scourging continued, when, reeking with perspiration,
Joe threw down the rod, and took up the
shovel.</p>

<p>Dapple expected nothing less than to be buried
alive, and with death staring her in the face,
remembered with compunction the manner in
which she had abused the kindness of the good
old man, and despised all his wise counsels. But
her quick discernment soon discovered that Joe
was about to dig the earth at one end to an inclined
plane to let her out, and instantly all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
remorse and resolutions for a better life were at
an end.</p>

<p>When he had graded the pit, as he thought, sufficiently,
he administered a few blows with the flat
of the shovel, and an energy that sent Dapple
flying from the pit like a hen from a hawk, observing,
as he went leisurely to work to fill up the
hole, “Much obliged to you, neighbor, for this
visit; call again the first opportunity.”</p>

<p>When Joe had filled up the pit, he flung some
brush over, took the pail, and went to milking,
never mentioning the matter, even to his wife, till
years afterwards.</p>

<p>The mare never found opportunity to comply
with Joe’s kind invitation. He might have left
his crops out of doors for all her.</p>

<p>Dapple mended her pace as she approached the
rising ground on which the Griffin homestead was
located, for she had often proved the hospitality
of its stable and pastures. The buildings were
situated on the summit of a hill, which rose quite
abruptly from the river. The blazing sun poured
down upon a house of enormous size, the lower
rooms finished, the rest a shell. Not a tree or a
bush, save one old stub, stood near it. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
not the least attempt at a garden, but, far out in
the field, in the midst of the corn, cabbage, beets,
carrots, and onions were growing, and peas now
ripe in the pod.</p>

<p>On one side of the front door was a goose-pen;
on the other a molasses hogshead, into which an
upright board conducted the rain water from the
eaves. The only approach to anything in the
shape of plants was some house leek (then considered
a sovereign remedy for <i>corns</i>), in an old
skillet.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the end door was a
small enclosure, made by driving stakes into the
ground, in which were roots of wormwood, tansy,
comfrey, lovage, and sweet agrimony, while an
enormous hop-vine covered a great part of the
front of the house. All about the door-yard were
shingle bolts, bunches of shingles, old yokes, logs,
sticks of hewn timber, drags, sleds, with the stakes
in, broken and whole, and a brush-harrow was
tipped up against the house, right under one of
the front windows, while between them the skin
of a bear, recently killed, was stretched and nailed
to the clapboards.</p>

<p>Beside the end door stood a leech, that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
been set up in the spring, to make soap, and suffered
to stand through the summer, as Mrs. Griffin
liked to have weak lye to scour with. Within a
gun-shot of the western end of the house stood
the stub of a massive pine, which had been broken
off about twenty-five feet from the ground, and
was hollow, having the opening on the north-west
side. In the cavity were augers, planes, saws,
chisels, shovels, axes, and canting dogs, thrown
together in most admirable confusion. The tools
were of English make, and evidently of excellent
temper, but covered with rust. From the dead
limbs on the outside hung rusty scythes and a
grain cradle. This was the Griffin tool-chest. An
eighth of a mile from the house, down under the
hill, was the well.</p>

<p>In the rough climate of New England, the inhabitants
were solicitous to place their buildings
in a lee, either under the side of a hill, the protection
of a wood, or to dispose the buildings themselves
in such a manner as to give them a sheltered
and sunny door and barn-yard. But here
the barn was a great distance from the house, the
buildings disposed without the least reference to
shelter, as though the occupants were insensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to wind or weather. Yet in other respects everything
betokened plenty and thrift; the walls were
well built of rocks of great size, and handsomely
laid up; the barns were large, and through the
open doors the hay could be seen, brought so far
over the floors that the mows nearly touched each
other, leaving barely room to swing a flail.</p>

<p>An immense log crib, the top covered with
boards and shingles, where the long yellow ears
of corn showed through the chinks, attested that
the thrifty owner kept a year’s stock of bread on
hand. On a scaffold of poles, laid over the high
beams, bundles of last year’s flax were visible,
while the number of milking-stools, hanging on the
barn-yard fence, gave token of a large dairy.</p>

<p>To complete the picture, four great hogs were
rooting in the chips after thistle roots, and a white
mare, with a sucking colt and two half-grown ones,
was standing in the shade, on the north side of
the house. As Parson Goodhue gained the summit
of the hill, and was not far from the old stub,
he saw approaching some one whose form was
nearly concealed by a huge back-load of spruce
poles, from twenty to twenty-five feet in length,
and bearing in one hand an axe. As he flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the poles from his shoulder, and stood erect, he
caught sight of the minister.</p>

<p>“Halloo, parson! Good morning. Glad to see
you. <i>Hot</i>&mdash;ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Edmund,” replied his visitor,
apparently not the least disconcerted by the rudeness
of the reception, and extending his hand,
which the other enclosed in his great palm, and
shook with a heartiness that caused the good man
to reel in his saddle.</p>

<p>“How are you, Elizabeth, and all the children?”</p>

<p>“Well, so’s to be crawling. Lizzy always keeps
herself worked down. ‘Tain’t so much the work,&mdash;though
we milk seven cows, for Lizzy’s a master
hand to turn off work, and real rugged,&mdash;but
she’s forever scrubbing and scouring. I tell her
‘tain’t a bit of use, but she will do it. Then father’s
a good deal of care.”</p>

<p>“How is the old gentleman?”</p>

<p>“He’s real strong at the stomach; eats and
sleeps as well as ever he did; but he sometimes
has the rheumatics.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">WHERE THE HARD STREAK CAME FROM.</p>


<p class="drop-cap03">THIS was Edmund Griffin, the proprietor of
seven hundred acres of excellent land, a very
large stock of cattle, and money besides&mdash;the
strongest man in town (leaving out Lion Ben, who
was an exception to everybody), now that Captain
Rhines and Uncle Isaac were getting in years.
He was not remarkably tall, being barely six feet
in his boots, but of vast proportions. There was
no beauty about Edmund; his hair was coarse as
rope-yarn, inclining to red, and, where it was not
confined by a cue, bristling; his waist was small
in proportion to the great breadth of his shoulders
and hips, his joints large, his lips and teeth very
prominent, which gave him the appearance of coming
at you. The whole expression of his face was
extremely rugged, and would have been fierce, had
it not been neutralized by the kindly expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of a clear, mild eye. His voice, also, was rather
loud and hearty than harsh in its tones. A skein
of woollen yarn was tied round him for a belt, his
breeches of dye-pot blue, and a flannel shirt that
had once been bright red, but so bleached by the
sun and perspiration as not to show any red save
under the armpits and below the girdle, from a
pocket in the breast of which stuck out the end
of a purse made of a sheep’s bladder; his open
collar revealed a finely-formed throat, and a breast
covered with a thick mass of curling brown hair.
This great, brawny man was possessed of remarkable
mechanical genius. With those great fingers
of his he could execute the nicest jobs, and he
was constantly resorted to by the neighbors; and
yet there was not a sled or cart on the premises
that had a decent tongue in it; they were all
made by cutting down a forked tree, and sticking
in the fork with the bark on.</p>

<p>“You’re getting fat, parson&mdash;fat as a porpoise;
you don’t do work enough; you ought to have
been in the woods with me this forenoon; ‘twould
make the gravy run, and take some of the grease
out of you.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with those poles,
Edmund?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Make pike-poles to drive logs with, in the fall
freshet.”</p>

<p>Parson Goodhue was much attached to Edmund
Griffin, who had grown up under him, and whom
he had married when he was but twenty and his
wife nineteen, and, though now surrounded by a
large family, was in the very maturity of his
strength; for he well knew that, though the outside
was as rough as the coat of the alligator,
there was a noble and generous nature within, and
a kindly heart throbbed beneath that hairy bosom
and faded shirt.</p>

<p>For many a long year he had been seeking his
good, and striving in vain to impress him with
religious ideas; but it was like lifting a wet cannon
ball; he eluded all his efforts; he could find
no chink in his armor. He was always at meeting
with his family, rain or shine, and an attentive
hearer. Anything, everything he would do for
Parson Goodhue, except listen to religious conversation;
<i>that</i> he would always avoid. He had no
sympathy in that direction, nor his wife either,
and the children naturally grew up with the same
ideas. Even the old father, ninety years of age,
and tottering on the verge of eternity, seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
have no notions beyond the present; and all his
talk was about lifting, wrestling, and the Indian
fights, in which he had played a most conspicuous
part, and, though he could with difficulty get
across the room, would, every few weeks, have his
rifle brought to him, and clean and oil the lock.</p>

<p>“Lizzy,” shouted Mr. Griffin, in a voice that
might be heard a mile.</p>

<p>This brought to the door a woman of a noble
form, dark-brown hair, and one of the sweetest
faces the eye ever rested upon, and, though evidently
just from the cheese-tub, very neatly
dressed.</p>

<p>“Lizzy, here’s Parson Goodhue come to stay to
dinner, and a fortnight longer, I hope.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” was the reply of his wife, as she
welcomed the visitor.</p>

<p>“Let the mare go, parson; she knows the way
to the barn; come, let’s go into the house.”</p>

<p>“I rather think, Edmund, I had better hitch her
to this stub; if she goes to the barn alone, she
will certainly be in mischief;” but as the minister
stepped forward, with the bridle in his hand, to
execute his design, Griffin caught him by the
shoulders, and exclaiming, “Bless me! where is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the man going?” lifted and set him aside, as though
he had been a feather; at the same time dropping
a stone upon the trencher of a bear trap, the great
jaws sprung together with a clang that caused
Parson Goodhue to jump clear from the ground
in mortal fear.</p>

<p>“Goodness, Edmund, do you set bear-traps for
your friends?”</p>

<p>“No, parson; I’m sorry for your fright, but you
see, we caught a bear last night, and the boys
have been playing with the trap, and left it set.
If you had got into it, ‘twould have broken your
leg.”</p>

<p>What a contrast between the outside and the
inside of the house, where Elizabeth Griffin held
undisputed sway! Silver was not brighter than
the pewter on the shelves, and white as the snow
flake were dressers and the nicely-sanded floor
of the best room into which the visitor was ushered,
where, seated in his arm-chair, was Joseph
Griffin, the grandfather, a vast ruin, the
great bones and cords of the old Indian-killer
standing out in bold relief through the shrunken
flesh.</p>

<p>“Father’s master hard of hearing, and his eyesight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
has failed him a good deal,” said his son;
“but otherways he’s just as bright as he ever
was; knows all that’s going on, and all the young
folks.”</p>

<p>“Father,” he shouted, as they entered the
room, “here’s Mr. Goodhue, come to see you.”</p>

<p>“Glad to see him; give him a cheer.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Griffin,” said the minister,
placing his chair close to the old gentleman; “you
have been spared to a great age.”</p>

<p>“<i>Spared!</i> I never spared myself. I allers took
the but-end of a log, and the bunt of a topsail.
Nobody can say that Joe Griffin ever spared himself.
Young man (Mr. Goodhue was on the wrong
side of sixty), when I was of your age, I had more
strength than I knew what to do with.”</p>

<p>“I said you had lived to a great age.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve been here a good while. I was
through the French and Indian wars. I was at
the takin’ of Quebec, in ‘59, but I was too old for
this last one.”</p>

<p>“I trust, sitting here alone so much as you do,
and knowing that you are living on borrowed
time, that you often think on your latter end, and
endeavor to prepare for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Leetle end; leetle end of what?”</p>

<p>“I say, I hope you are prepared to go.”</p>

<p>“I don’t go anywhere; I can’t for the rheumatics,
only to town meetin’, and then they put
me into Isaac Murch’s wagin; before he had
that, they hauled me on an ox sled.”</p>

<p>“I mean, I hope you are prepared to die, and
meet your Maker.”</p>

<p>“O, die, is it? I never killed nobody (except
in fair fight), and nobody ever killed me. I never
abused my neighbors, or the cattle, and I think
it’s everybody’s duty to live just as long as they
kin. It’s an awful thing to kill yourself; when
anybody has sich thoughts, they ought to put ‘em
right out o’ their minds.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that is all the preparation you
need?”</p>

<p>“I allers kept up good line fence, and give
good weight and measure. I s’pose the less we
do, the less there’s charged to us.”</p>

<p>Mr. Goodhue now relinquished the effort in
despair; as Uncle Isaac would have said, he could
find nothing to nail to. The old man had grown
up, like the beasts he hunted, without culture,
and could neither read nor write. But, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
he found great difficulty in hearing, he could talk
fast enough, and however impervious to religious
sentiment, was shrewd enough in other matters.</p>

<p>The subject which at that period most divided
the opinions and agitated the minds of the people,
was the state of affairs in France, and our relations
to that nation. That nation having dethroned
their king, and proclaimed liberty and equality,
naturally expected to receive fraternal sympathy
and aid from this country, and from the people
whom they had aided in their recent struggle for
liberty.</p>

<p>The members in Congress were divided in
sentiment on the subject. The people at large,
especially the mercantile portion of the community
(who were very much embittered against
England on account of the impressment of seamen
and the right of search), felt that the movement
in France was resistance to arbitrary power, a
struggle for self-government against oppression,
and a mere carrying out of the principles of our
own revolution, that we owed it to the cause of
liberty, and were obligated in gratitude to aid
them to the extent of entering into an offensive
and defensive alliance, and declaring war with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Great Britain. The party espousing these sentiments
was large and influential, and a strong pressure
was brought to bear upon the administration.
To complicate matters still more, Genet, the French
minister, a hot-headed, overbearing man, appealed
to the prejudices and sympathies of the people,
and, without the sanction or knowledge of the government,
attempted to raise men and arms, and fit
out privateers to prey on British commerce, and
sell their prizes in American ports.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Washington, and those of
cooler heads and calmer judgment, shocked at the
excesses of the French revolution, and having no
confidence in the capacity of the French people
for self-government, were as resolutely opposed to
any interference. Old Mr. Griffin, in opposition
to his son and the great majority of his neighbors,
was of the latter party, and Mr. Goodhue was of
the same opinion.</p>

<p>“What’s that rapscallion’s name, parson, that’s
come over here, and is kickin’ up sich a dust, and
tryin’ to get us into a quarrel with the old country?”</p>

<p>“Genet, the French minister,” replied Mr.
Goodhue, rejoiced at the introduction of a topic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in respect to which their sympathies were in
unison.</p>

<p>“A minister goin’ about tryin’ to stir up people
agin their government, and to git up a war!”</p>

<p>“He’s not a minister of the gospel, but a sort of
ambassador.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I wish my eye was as quick and my
hand as steady as ‘twas once, and I had him within
range of my rifle; I’d put an eend to his trampin’;”
at the same time striking his cane violently on the
floor. Captain Rhines was here t’other day, settin’
right where you set, and sayin’ we never should
got our liberty, if’t hadn’t been for them are
French; that one good turn deserved another; and
all that. I ups and tells him, I does, says I, the
French waited till they see how the cat was goin’
to jump, and that we were like to wear the old
bull-dog out, and then comes in to bet on the winnin’
horse. I telled him the French were well
enough, but it wasn’t so much for any love to us
they come; England had took Canada, and robbed
‘em of their colonies, and now they wanted to pay
her in her own coin, and help us get clear on ‘em;
they’ll eny time send over troops to help the Irish
when they undertake to rise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think you are right in that, Mr. Griffin.”</p>

<p>“If we should go into war with England now, it
would make an eend of our leetle commerce; but
if we go on as we’ve begun, in a few years we
shall be able to fight our own battles, no thanks
to eny on ‘em.”</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly willing to abide by the judgment
of General Washington, Hamilton, and those who
have carried us thus far. I believe Washington
was raised up and divinely appointed to carry
us through the revolutionary war, as evidently as
Moses was to lead the children of Israel to the
promised land.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk, parson. I don’t know enything
‘bout Moses, and them old characters, but I know
‘bout Gineral Washington, cause I fought under
him, when he was kernel; yes, I go in for the old
horse that never balked at the steepest hill, but
allus pulled, whether the load went, or whether
other horses pulled or not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my old friend, the heart of the country
rests safely on Washington.”</p>

<p>“Then, parson, he’s a prayin’ man. Isaac Murch
told me that; he said, that winter at Valley Forge,
when the soldiers were barefoot, and suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
so much, there was an hour at noon when he
couldn’t be seen; if an express came, he wouldn’t
be disturbed; it was allers thought and said
among the men, that he was at prayer. I allers
thought them are the sort of men to foller.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; because in following them we may
hope for the aid of Him by whom they are guided.”</p>

<p>“There’s a great many in this place, parson, if
you allow that there’s any good thing in an Englishman,
cry out, ‘Tory’!”</p>

<p>“That’s too much the case, I know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to swaller an Englishman whole.
I know they press our seamen, and are overbearin’;
but, then, they press their own likewise, take
a man from his own doorstep; but ‘tain’t the people,
it’s the government, does that. They say this
new man that’s come up&mdash;What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Bonaparte.”</p>

<p>“That he’s goin’ to lick the English into shoe-strings.”</p>

<p>“Then he’ll do what has not been done for the
last two hundred years.”</p>

<p>“I tell you it ain’t in ‘em, parson; it’ ain’t in
the men that live on frogs and soup to lick the
men that eat beef and pork, I don’t care who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
they’re led by. When I was payin’ for my place,
I follered the sea a good deal. I have been in
English ports and French ports; fought side by
side with Englishmen, and aginst Frenchmen; and
I don’t care who knows it, I like an Englishman
better’n a Frenchman eny day. When it’s good
weather at sea, and everything goin’ well, an Englishman
is a grouty chap; he’ll growl at the wind,
the ship, the grub, and the usage; but let there
come a gale of wind, a raal tryin’ time, the lee
riggin’ hangin’ in bights, men three or four hours
on a yard tryin’ to smother a sail, or the ship
sprung a leak and like to go down, I tell you,
John Bull is there. The harder it blows, the
blacker it looks, and the tougher it comes, the
higher his spirit rises; then they’re a Protestant
people, and that’s a thing goes a good ways with
me.”</p>

<p>Our readers may suspect that the old gentleman
was not so obtuse in relation to religious
matters as he appeared; an idea of this kind
seemed to cross the mind of Mr. Goodhue, for he
instantly attempted to introduce a religious conversation;
but the old man shrunk from it as
speedily as a turtle draws his head into the shell
when apprehensive of danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>When Edmund Griffin returned to the kitchen,
he said, “Come, wife, ain’t you going to do something?
There ain’t a speck of fire on the hearth.”</p>

<p>“What of that? I’ve got baked beans, brown
bread, pies, and an Indian pudding in the oven,
and I must put this cheese in press.”</p>

<p>“<i>Baked beans!</i> I want to kill some chickens,
make a smother, and give the old gentleman a
good tuck out.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, make me up a fire; the boys are
all in the field.”</p>

<p>He brought in a great log, and threw it on the
hearth; then, bringing in a huge armful of wood,
the moment he was inside the door, let drive
right into the middle of the room, at the same time
kicking the door to with his feet. Proceeding to
put on the log, instead of using the great kitchen
shovel to rake forward the ashes from the back,
he put in his foot, and, after scraping out a hole,
flung on the log with such force that the coals and
ashes flew all over the room.</p>

<p>“Edmund, what a splutter you do make! Do
go and get the chickens. I had rather make two
fires than clean up after you.”</p>

<p>Taking the mare’s bridle on his arm, he put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
her in the barn; returning with the bridle in one
hand, and a dish of corn in the other, he threw it
among the fowls; as they were busily eating, he
brought down the bridle on the flock with such
force as to prostrate half a dozen, and picking them
up, cut off their heads, and soon transferred them
to the kitchen table.</p>

<p>“Why, Edmund,” cried his wife, looking them
over, “what a careless creature you are! Half of
these are old hens; and, as sure as I live, you’ve
killed Winthrop’s setting hen. She was just ready
to hatch. He will cry his eyes out. I do wish I’d
gone myself; the chickens are all lost, and we
shall have to throw the hen away. She’s all skin
and bone.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, wife; the boy can set another.
Have you got everything you want now?”</p>

<p>“No. I want you to wash yourself, and put on
a clean shirt and clothes. They’re on the bed.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use, wife? I’m well enough.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, you shan’t come to dinner looking
so!” she exclaimed, pushing him into the bedroom,
and pulling the skein of yarn from his
waist.</p>

<p>With a groan he obeyed, and, making him sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
down on the edge of the bed, she combed out
his cue, and tied it up with a black ribbon, instead
of the eel-skin.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodhue, who had a large family of his
own, was very fond of children, and it was a
curious sight to see Winthrop Griffin tugging
the stately old minister by the hand, to see his
fowl and playthings, his tame crow, and the woodchuck
he had caught. The good man also sincerely
sympathized with him respecting the loss
of his hen and expected brood of chickens.</p>

<p>Mrs. Griffin would have persuaded the minister
to lie down after dinner; but as the boys
were going to work in the field, he wished to
read the Scriptures and have prayers before they
went away, it being his constant custom. The
parents and children all listened with the greatest
respect and attention, but all attempts to engage
the seniors in conversation of a religious nature
were useless.</p>

<p>After the evening meal, when Parson Goodhue
prepared to depart, Dapple, true to her
instincts, was found in a chamber over the stable
where Griffin kept grain. She had gone up a
flight of stairs, but all attempts to induce her to
go down by the same were unavailing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here, parson,” said Edmund; “let me
knock her on the head, and take her for wolf
bait&mdash;there’s a bounty on wolves,&mdash;and I’ll give
you my roan colt, that’s worth a dozen of her.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Goodhue entreated for the life of his
beast. Griffin, then putting a great pile of hay
on the stable floor beneath, took up the boards
of the floor above, and forced her to jump down.</p>

<p>“What a strange family,” said the good man
to himself as he returned, his saddle-bags stuffed
to their utmost extent. “I would be content
with less respect and kindness shown to myself
if they would only manifest some respect for my
Master. How sad to see that old man so thoughtless!
Well, the children are different. Joe is a
good man,&mdash;there is certainly encouragement there,&mdash;and
Walter takes after his mother; if she was
anywhere else, she would be different.”</p>

<p>In the course of the autumn, Dapple ended
her eventful life; in trying to get over a fence
with the fetters on, she got cast, and beat herself
to death, thus dying as she had lived. Two
days after, the parson, on going to his barn to
feed his cattle, found a noble-looking roan horse
in Dapple’s stall, a present from Edmund Griffin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>In this slight glance at the Griffins, we have
seen where the hard streak came from. That
old grandfather’s was gradually diluted as it
mingled with other and more kindly blood, till in
Walter rudeness had become attempered to firmness,
and nothing more.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">RECONNOITRING.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IT was an overcast night; there was no moon;
the stars were bright overhead, but around
the edge of the horizon they were obscured by
thin clouds, through which a star occasionally
shone.</p>

<p>The brigantine, with all sail set, was running
in for the land, the dark outline of which could
be dimly seen in the distance. The French had
put out the light on Planier Island, and removed
all the buoys from the shoals and reefs, that
they might not be of advantage to the enemy;
but the lights of the English frigate could be
seen far ahead, as she also stood in for the land,
her commander not dreaming he was followed by
the vessel, so nearly his prize, and which he
supposed effectually frightened from that locality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“It would have been a very valuable prize to
us, could we have taken her,” said the captain
of the frigate to his lieutenant; (”and at one time
I thought she was ours,) not merely as far as the
value of her cargo was concerned; but we could
have put a few guns aboard of her, and a crew,
and she is so fast she would have taken everything
on the coast; our prize-money would soon
have amounted to something very handsome.”</p>

<p>“Where did the Yankees learn to build such
vessels? Before the war they couldn’t make
their own mouse-traps.”</p>

<p>“It was the war taught them; they wanted privateers
to prey on our merchantmen and supply
ships. They wanted sharp vessels to run into
neutral ports, and escape our frigates, and they
built them. Since they set up for themselves,
they make rigging and duck, roll iron, and forge
anchors, and there’s no telling where they will
stop.”</p>

<p>“We may catch her yet, if we could get her
before the wind, where she could not run into
shoal water, or have the good fortune to come
across her in a calm.”</p>

<p>“He’ll not come here again; he’s run too great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
a risk. He will be more likely to try Toulon;
perhaps go round into the Bay of Biscay, to some
of the ports on the other side.”</p>

<p>The wind, which had blown very fresh all
through the afternoon and first part of the night,
had moderated to a good working breeze.</p>

<p>As the watch on board the brigantine that
brought twelve o’clock came on deck, a large
rock was discovered right ahead; the topsail was
hove to the mast, and the vessel became stationary.
The captain, calling the whole crew aft,
said to them, “Boys, I want to put a man on that
rock, to watch this frigate and the sixty-four, see
which way they stand in the morning, and where
they go; also to look into the roadstead, and see
what vessels are there, and how they lie; in short,
to keep himself concealed, and get all the information
he can. To-morrow night I’ll run in, and take
him off. Who’ll volunteer?”</p>

<p>Before the words were fairly out of his mouth,
or any other could reply, Walter Griffin exclaimed,
“I will go, sir.”</p>

<p>Peterson had from Walter’s childhood cherished
a great affection for him, and Walter loved
the black with all his heart. It was at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a childhood liking (as children care very little
about color), which increased as he grew older;
and Peterson, by reforming his habits, became
deserving of respect.</p>

<p>Peterson was not merely a finished sailor and
first-rate calker, but was also exceedingly ingenious
in making kites, windmills, boats, sleds, carts,
squirts, popguns, sawyers, and all those things
that children and boys want; and no one but
Uncle Isaac could equal him in the manufacture
of bows and arrows.</p>

<p>Peterson lived not far from Walter’s father.
Every leisure day Walter was there; everything
he wanted Peterson made, and, as he outgrew kites
and bows, instructed him in wrestling, making
sailor knots, and built him a skiff; when, therefore,
he came to be shipmate with him, he felt
that the boy was in a manner committed to him,
and under his protection, and instantly interfered.</p>

<p>“Massa cap’n, dat boy no fit to go; he too young;
s’pose come gale ob wind; vessel driben to sea;
no get him off long time; boy be frightened, die,
p’rhaps starve. Hab to show hisself; den English
man-o’-war take him; nebber see his farder or
mudder no more. Boy no ‘sperience to know
what to look for; me go, meself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Walter, however, insisted upon going; he had
a right to go; the captain called for volunteers,
and he had volunteered, and was going.</p>

<p>“But you too young, chile, for such ting.”</p>

<p>“<i>Young</i>,” replied Walter, in high dudgeon; “I
shipped before the mast, and have a man’s wages,
and can steer my trick, and do my duty.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do without <i>you</i>, pilot,” said the captain.</p>

<p>Several others had also intended to volunteer,
and now came forward; but Walter had been too
quick for them, and claimed his right.</p>

<p>“Captain,” said Fred Williams, as he took leave
of Arthur Brown, “you’ll find one of our young
men aboard, Walter Griffin (he’s not much more
than a boy, but he’s a choice one); I know him
through and through. He never should have left
me if I could have helped it; but he seems one
of those made to go to sea. Put him anywhere,
trust him with any matter, and he will give a good
account of himself. You will find him better, on
an emergency, than many older persons; for he
belongs to an iron-sided race, and what he lacks
in experience he will make up in mother wit.”</p>

<p>All that the captain had seen of Walter went to
corroborate Fred’s statement, and he determined
to try him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Ned now besought the captain to permit
him to share the adventure with Walter, but he
refused, telling him he had promised his mother
not to expose him unnecessarily; that one was
enough, and two would be more likely to attract
attention.</p>

<p>Ned turned away, with a tear in his eye, and
walked forward. Flinging his arms round his
friend’s neck, he said, “He won’t let me go, Walter.
It’s too bad; we might have such a good
time!”</p>

<p>The boat was manned, and beef, bread, water,
and raw pork put into her. The raw pork was in
addition, as that could, on occasion, be eaten raw;
and if the vessel should be blown off the coast, he
might be left there a good while, and no fire could
be made to cook, without attracting notice.</p>

<p>The captain, after giving him his instructions,
put into his hands a spy-glass. “There,” said he,
“is a glass with which you can read letters three
inches long a mile away.” He then shook hands
with him at the side, bidding him take care of
himself, and keep a bright lookout, while the tender-hearted
black fairly shed tears.</p>

<p>“Look out for de man-o’-war, sonnie. S’pose he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
ketch you, Peterson chase you all ober de world
but he git you.”</p>

<p>“Good by, dear Walter,” cried Ned, throwing
his arms around his friend’s neck, as he stood up
in the stern sheets to step on the rock.</p>

<p>“Good by, Ned,” said Walter, returning the
embrace.</p>

<p>The provision and water were landed, and the
boat pulled rapidly away. Walter sat down upon
the rock, listening to the sound of the oars in the
rowlocks, and watching the phosphorescence of the
water as it flashed on their blades. All these
tokens of departure, of little moment on ordinary
occasions, now possessed not a little interest. He
marked the ring of the iron, as the hook of the
davit-fall went into the ring-bolt, and heard the
man say, “Hoist away,” the creak of the blocks,
and the slat of the canvas, as the sails filled, then
the low, rushing sound of the vessel’s bow as it
parted the water. It was a lonely moment to the
brave boy, when the last low sound betokening
companionship was lost in the dash of midnight
waves, the gleam of her white canvas faded from
his view, and he was left on the wild rock alone.
He had never been taught to breathe a petition for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
protection, or to depend upon aught but himself.
His conversation with Charlie by the brook constituted
the only appeal of a religious nature ever
made to his heart.</p>

<p>He knew not the nature or extent of the rock
on which he had been so unceremoniously deposited,
and, clambering up to where he was above
the flow of the tide, placed his provisions beside
him, and determined to keep watch till the day
broke, that he might have time to examine the
place before he could be observed from any passing
boat or vessel. Fearing, if he went to sleep,
he might sleep too long, and finding a flat place on
the rock, he paced back and forth, to keep himself
awake.</p>

<p>Little Ned, feeling very lonely in the absence
of his watch-mate, attached himself to Peterson,
between whom and Walter there was such a good
understanding, in order that he might talk about
Walter, Pleasant Cove, the Griffins, and all the
people and boys he had become acquainted with
there.</p>

<p>The rock on which Walter was placed might
have been, at low water, half an acre in extent,
and irregular in its form, the eastern end rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in a high bluff, with deep water around and close
to it; but the western end sloped into long, ragged
ridges, honeycombed by the everlasting dash
of surf, and terminating in long reefs, upon which
the sea broke with a continuous roar. Between
these ridges were openings or coves, quite wide
at the extremities of the reefs, shoaling and narrowing
as they ran up into the main portion of the
rock, in such a manner that it was easy to enter
them in a boat between the breaking points, and
land, in good weather, with perfect safety.</p>

<p>The heads of these coves were filled with those
materials the sea usually flings up&mdash;sea-weeds,
shells, barrel staves, chips, planks, and broken
pieces of vessels.</p>

<p>On the eastern end of the rock was a patch of
turf extending from the edge of the bold cliffs
along the heads of the coves, covered with bushes
and scrub trees, dwarfed by the sea winds, and
thickly matted together.</p>

<p>The sun had risen clear, bringing with it a moderate
easterly breeze. The English frigate before
referred to is passing within musket shot of the
eastern extremity of the rock. A close observer
might have noticed the branches of a pine bush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
move in a direction opposite to the wind, and in a
few moments the head of a man is cautiously
thrust through the branches. It is Walter Griffin.
He watches with keen eyes the course of the man-o’-war,
and, as she increases the distance between
them, crawls to the shelter of a ledge, and, resting
his glass over it, watches her till she disappears
from view. From his position he can command a
view of the roadstead, the men-of-war lying at
anchor in it, the forts, and the entrance to the
port.</p>

<p>At the head of one of the coves, in which there
was a little beach of white sand, a portion of the
stern frame of a vessel had, by the conjunction of
a high tide and a gale of wind, been flung high on
the rocks, extending from one side to the other,
leaving a space of several feet between it and the
beach. Here Walter had bestowed his water and
food.</p>

<p>Having made all the observation possible, he
retired to this place, and, with some dry sea-weed
for a bed, lay down for a nap, as he had been up
the entire night.</p>

<p>When he awoke, he espied a French fisherman,
fishing among the kelp for rock-fish. Looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
cautiously around, to be sure that no vessel
was in sight, he, after a while, succeeded in attracting
his attention, and prevailing upon him
to row into one of the passages between the
rocks, where he met him.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked the fisherman, resting
upon his oars, and surprised to be addressed in
his own language by one who, he perceived, was
of another nation.</p>

<p>“An American.”</p>

<p>“Have you run away from the man-o’-war?”
asked the Frenchman, taking him for some impressed
American seaman, who had swum off
from a British vessel.</p>

<p>“No; I was put ashore here last night from an
American vessel, that is trying to run the blockade,
to watch the fleet; she will stand in for the
land again to-night.”</p>

<p>“The vessel they were chasing yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“We thought you were gone.”</p>

<p>“We thought so ourselves, till the wind came.”</p>

<p>“Men sometimes swim ashore from the fleet.
I thought you had swam to the rock. I’ve got
an Englishman in my house now who ran away
a week ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why don’t they take you prisoner?”</p>

<p>“They don’t trouble the fishermen, and when
they want fish, they pay for them; but our vessels
and the Spaniards take ‘em without thanks
or money.”</p>

<p>“What time in the day is it?”</p>

<p>“By the tide, about eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Could you take me ashore in your boat, so
that I could have a good look at the fleet and
harbor, and see the Englishman you spoke of,
and bring me back after dark?”</p>

<p>“I can take you ashore well enough, but
bringing you back is another matter; the English
have boats rowing around the roadstead in the
night; if they saw me going out after dark, they
would suspect something, and stop me.”</p>

<p>“I would give a good deal to get inside the
roadstead, and to see that deserter.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do all I can to help you. I’ll take you
along shore to one of the creeks where there is
no watch kept, and set you off from there.”</p>

<p>The Frenchman made Walter lie down in the
bottom of the boat, covered him with sea-weed,
and flung fish over him; he then put up his sail,
and steered boldly into the roadstead. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
passed one of the English ships, he was hailed
and asked for a mess of fish; he went alongside,
and flung the fish on the grating of the
side ladder, and receiving his money, kept on.</p>

<p>“If they had known who was under these
fish,” said the fisherman to Walter, pulling the
sea-weed off from him, as they came under the
guns of the French castle, “it would have put
an end to my fishing.”</p>

<p>He now conducted Walter to the observatory,
situated on very high ground, in which was
a powerful telescope, and from which he could
track the frigate and sloop of war as they ran
along the coast, and see perfectly the position
of the ships in the roadstead. He found the
flag-ship lay the farthest in, just out of range
of the forts, and so moored as to completely command
the channel. Having taken careful note
of all these things, and made a rough draft on
paper, he went to the fisherman’s house, where
he found the English sailor, who informed him
of many particulars that were important, and
among other things, that a supply ship was
daily expected on the coast and was eagerly
looked for, as provisions were growing short
in the fleet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is her name?” asked Walter.</p>

<p>“The Severn.”</p>

<p>“Where has that frigate probably gone?”</p>

<p>“To Toulon.”</p>

<p>“And the sixty-four?”</p>

<p>“Round the other side, to carry despatches.”</p>

<p>“How big is the flag-ship?”</p>

<p>“A hundred guns.”</p>

<p>“Do they keep a keen lookout?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is no use to try to run by her at night;
she wouldn’t leave you a stick to do it with.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">DID I BEAR IT LIKE A MAN, WALTER?</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IT was nearly one o’clock at night, when the
brigantine hove to, off the rock, a boat put off,
and the sharp voice of Ned, crying, “Are you there,
Walter?” came over the waves. But it was now
blowing fresh, the sky obscured by clouds, and no
possibility of landing on the rock, which was
white with foam, it being so small that the sea ran
all round it. The boat, pulled by men who had
been all their lives brought up among the surf,
and accustomed to working around breakers, was
backed in within two seas of the rock, and held
there by the oars, while she stood almost on end.</p>

<p>“Now, shipmate,” said Danforth Eaton, standing
up in the stern sheets, with a coil of rope in his
hand, “look out for the line, and jump for it.”</p>

<p>Walter caught the line, and making it fast round
his waist, flung himself into the surf, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
hauled aboard, where he was joyfully received by
Ned, to whom one day and a portion of two nights
had seemed a week.</p>

<p>When the young captain had received Walter’s
information, he complimented him very much for
the shrewdness he had manifested; and as all were
equally interested (the profits of the voyage being
divided in this manner, the vessel, that is, the
owners, drew a certain proportion, the captain,
mates, and crew another, according to their rank),
he spread the whole matter before the ship’s company.</p>

<p>Said the young captain to his crew, “The wind
is fair, and plenty of it; the tide also is with us,
and sets up the harbor; we should go like a shot;
the frigate and sixty-four are out of the way;
there is no moon, and it is overcast; if they fire at
us, they will have to fire by guess, for they can’t
sight over the black cannon; probably we shall
not have so many things in our favor again. I am
in for trying it to-night; but I want your opinions,
for we must run the risk of their broadsides.”</p>

<p>“I reckon,” said Danforth Eaton, “that when
we shipped aboard this craft, we knew what we
had to kalkerlate on; we expect to get our profit
out of our risk; I’m for trying it now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>His opinion being assented to by the crew, the
brigantine, with a spanking breeze and every sail
set, was steered directly for the roadstead, a little
over two miles distant. It seemed but a moment,
so rapid was her progress, before the high lands of
Marseilles were throwing their shadows before her
path. Walter acting as second mate, his station
was in his watch on deck, aft. He, however, still
shared Ned’s berth, as the second mate was sick
in his own. It was now his watch below; but in
the present circumstances, no one felt any inclination
to sleep, and he was, with all the rest of the
crew, forward. At such a time, it is natural for
those most acquainted to get together, and the
men were divided into little knots, conversing in
low tones. Walter, Enoch Hadlock, and Ben
Peterson, having been schoolmates, and grown up
together, formed one group, with Ned nestled close
to the side of Walter.</p>

<p>“Walter,” said Ben, “do you expect, if we
make the run, and a heap of money, to have the
second mate’s share, while he’s off duty?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed; I have no right to it. He can’t
help having a carbuncle. I wouldn’t take it if it
was offered me. I wouldn’t be so mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“But if you’re doing second mate’s duty&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The honor pays for that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you think it is a stepping-stone. I
hope it is.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that.”</p>

<p>“We shall soon see what our young captain is
made of,” said Eaton, as the dark hull and long
masts of the ship of the line began to appear;
“I only wish we were well through it.”</p>

<p>A man-o’-war cutter was now seen on the lee
bow.</p>

<p>“What ship is that?” was the hail.</p>

<p>“The Severn, supply.”</p>

<p>Thus boats and ships were passed, the night
being too dark, and the brigantine going too quick
to admit of a close scrutiny. The name of the
expected store-ship being given, also completely
disarmed suspicion. They were now rapidly
nearing the flag-ship, of a hundred guns&mdash;the
last and most fearful ordeal. A death-like stillness
now pervaded the brigantine, broken only by the
rushing of the vessel through the water, the
straining of the cordage, and the moan of the
wind through the rigging.</p>

<p>“Walter,” whispered Ned, “do you feel afraid?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, Ned; do you?”</p>

<p>“I guess not; but I feel as I never did before.
I wish we were doing something, and it was not
so dreadfully still,” said the boy, putting his arm
round his companion’s waist, as they sat side by
side on the windlass, gazing through the darkness at
the lights of the man-of-war. “Kiss me, Walter.”</p>

<p>He put his arms round his friend, and pressed
his lips to his cheek. So dark was the night now
grown, and so rapid the passage of the vessel, that
the stern lights of the ship bore over the cat-head
of the brigantine.</p>

<p>The young captain now took the helm, when a
hail came from the ship that thrilled the blood of
every man on board.</p>

<p>“What ship is that? Reply, or I’ll sink you.”</p>

<p>“The Severn, store vessel.”</p>

<p>The ports of the man-of-war were triced up, and
by the gleam of the battle lantern, the gunners
could be seen standing by their pieces.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay. Come to, under the stern, and report
on board at six o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay,” was the reply; and “Hard a-lee!
Haul aft the main sheet!” were shouted, in loud
tones, on board the brigantine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The officer of the deck, who could distinguish
nothing, hearing these orders, was for an instant
deceived&mdash;an instant that was the salvation of
the brigantine, going twelve knots under the combined
force of wind and tide. Perceiving immediately
that it was a ruse, he gave orders to fire.
The horizon was lit up by the flash of guns, and
the midnight stillness broken by the roar of cannon.
But so well had the brigantine improved
her opportunity, that but one or two of the forward
guns were brought to bear on her.</p>

<p>As the iron shower came hurtling on, and
passed, a groan was heard near the foot of the
main-mast. It came from little Ned, who was
struck as he came aft with an order from the pilot.</p>

<p>“Bear it like a man, Neddie,” cried Walter, as
he held him in his arms. “Are you hurt much?”</p>

<p>“Yes, bad, Walter.” And he fainted.</p>

<p>“Take care of him,” said the captain, “till the
vessel is brought to.”</p>

<p>For a few moments every one was exerting
himself to the utmost, in order to bring the vessel,
under such a press of sail, to anchor under the
guns of the castle of St. Nicolas.</p>

<p>She was somewhat disabled, a round shot having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
cut off her main boom at the jaws to such an extent
that it broke and fell on deck, carrying away
the rail. Several shot had passed through the
sails and bulwarks, one had cut off the tiller-head,
and the mate had received a wound in the leg; so
that the attention of the captain was fully occupied
in taking care of the vessel.</p>

<p>During this period, which, though really but a
short time, seemed an age to Walter, he sat with
his back against the main-mast, his arms around
Neddie’s waist, and felt the warm blood oozing
slowly through his fingers.</p>

<p>The artillery now began to thunder from the
castle at the boats of the fleet, which, enraged at
the audacity and success of the enterprise, endeavored
to follow and cut out the brigantine, but,
finding the enemy aware of their designs, relinquished
it.</p>

<p>A boat was immediately sent to the castle for a
surgeon, who, having restored Ned by stimulants,
proceeded to examine his hurts, and ascertained
that he had received a severe flesh wound in the
thigh from a splinter, parts of which still remained
in the wound. He had also received a musket
ball in the groin, which, passing round the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
without breaking the bone, could be felt in the
flesh of the back, near the spine. Being just beneath
the skin, he pronounced neither of the
wounds mortal.</p>

<p>“Thank God for that!” exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>The surgeon wished to fasten him to the cabin
table while he performed the operation; but Ned
resisted this, declaring he could bear it if the captain
would stand beside him, and Walter would
hold his hand. The extraction of the splinters
was more painful than even the cutting for the
ball; but the little fellow bore it all with firmness,
scarcely uttering a groan, and without aid from
any of the means now in use to produce insensibility,
they being at that period unknown.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I bear it like a man, Walter?” asked
Ned, when the operation was over.</p>

<p>“Bravely,” answered Walter.</p>

<p>The captain would not send Ned to the hospital,
but hired a room for him in the house of Jacques
Bernoux, the fisherman whose acquaintance Walter
made on the rock, and sent Walter and Peterson
alternately to take care of him, going daily
himself to see him.</p>

<p>Ned, who was as sweet-tempered as ambitious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
had always been the pet of the crew, most of
whom he had known while at Pleasant Cove;
they were, therefore, always ready to watch of a
night whenever needed, and there were so many
of them that the duty was not at all burdensome.</p>

<p>Boys of Ned’s age learn a language with great
rapidity, and he soon began to pick up words,
and talk with the people of the house. Nothing
could exceed the kindness of Peterson to the little
wounded fellow. He was so strong he could lift
him easily, and, as he gradually recovered, made
him many little messes (being a skillful cook) that
were very grateful to the convalescent. Ned began
to love his black friend dearly, and always
called him James.</p>

<p>To the surprise of all but the surgeon, Ned
recovered a great deal faster than the first mate,
Mr. Rogers, who was only wounded in the leg,
the ball passing through. The wound continued
to run, and seemed as if it never would heal,
while Ned could walk across the floor with the
aid of Walter.</p>

<p>One day Ned was sitting in a chair, propped
up with pillows, and eating, with the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
relish, a nice breakfast Peterson had prepared for
him. “James,” said he, laying down his knife and
fork, “I’m glad I was wounded.”</p>

<p>“Glad you wounded! Glad you hab so much
pain, be sick so long, make de cap’n so much
trouble, all ob us feel bad! Nebber hear sich ting
afore.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean I was glad of that, or that I
should want to be wounded again; but I’m glad,
now it’s over, I’ve been through it.”</p>

<p>“I know what you tink; you tink, when you
git home to Salem, farder, mudder so glad cause
you wasn’t killed; den, when you walks in de
street, all de people say, ‘Dere Ned Gates; he one
smart boy; he been shipwrecked, almost starve
on a raft; been wounded two times runnin’ de
blockade; see what dat boy been through.’ Den
all de boys dey open dere eyes wide and stare,
say notin’.”</p>

<p>“That is it, James. I <i>have</i> been through a
good deal&mdash;haven’t I, for a boy no older than I
am?”</p>

<p>“Dat de Lord; he carry you through dat cause
you good boy.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t a very good boy, James.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“What de reason? Cap’n say you good boy,
mate say you good boy, eberybody say so.”</p>

<p>The brigantine, as she lay under the guns of
the fort, was recognized by the officers of the
blockading fleet as the vessel they had chased,
and so nearly taken, and they determined she
should not escape them a second time, therefore
kept incessant watch.</p>

<p>The roadstead of Marseilles is exposed to severe
gales, during which, the blockading fleet were
compelled to run to sea. The captain of the brigantine
had made too much money to run any
unnecessary risk in getting home; he, therefore,
determined to wait for a gale of wind that should
drive his antagonists to sea, before he attempted to
run out. This gave time for Ned to recover sufficiently
to go in the vessel. As the mate, Mr.
Rogers, was not well enough to do duty, Walter
was put in his place, which offended the second
mate very much, who thought, and said to the
captain, that the place belonged to him; to which
the captain replied, that Griffin had run some risk
in volunteering to go on the rock; that it was
<i>principally</i>, if not entirely, due to his shrewdness
in getting hold of the fisherman, and obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the information he did from the English sailor,
that their adventure succeeded, and they were
not sunk by the man-of-war. He therefore considered
promotion no more than a suitable reward,
especially as the second mate, though a good
seaman, was not a navigator. Thus Walter experienced
at the outset the benefit of knowledge,
as well as of pluck and principle.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE BASKET-MAKER.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IT was a glad day to Ned, when he had so far
recovered that the surgeon, yielding to his
solicitations, told him he might go on board the
vessel, spend most of the day, and come back
at night.</p>

<p>The fisherman’s house was not far from the pier.
Walter and Peterson made a chair, by taking
hold of each other’s wrists, and Ned, seated on
it, with an arm round each of their necks, was
taken on board.</p>

<p>The weather was warm, and some blankets from
Walter’s berth were spread on the hen-coop, and
a pillow placed so that Ned could lie down or sit
up, as he chose, see what was going on, and chat
with his shipmates, who were all rejoiced to see
him on board again. Peterson prepared his dinner,
but Ned wanted to eat with the rest, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
seemed so much more sociable, having been compelled
for so long a time to eat alone.</p>

<p>It was just after dinner; Ned was sitting, propped
up with pillows, the captain seated near by, watching
him, when he noticed an old man, apparently
over sixty years of age, in seaman’s dress, coming
along the gangway plank. His hair, where it
came outside his tarpaulin, was gray; he stooped
very much, appearing feeble, and bore on his back
a large number of articles manufactured of willows,
and strung together by a cord.</p>

<p>Approaching the captain, he deposited the bundle
on the deck, evidently much fatigued, and
asked, in English, if he would like to buy any of his
work&mdash;market-baskets, knife-baskets, table-mats,
ladies’ work-baskets, and many articles, merely
ornamental, of superior workmanship and most
beautifully stained.</p>

<p>There was something in his whole demeanor
that was both modest and prepossessing&mdash;quite
the reverse of street-venders in general.</p>

<p>“There,” said he, “is a market-basket that
would be very handy on board ship; and here,”&mdash;producing
a basket nearly square, and with partings
in it for tumblers,&mdash;“is an article that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
be very convenient on a cabin table, or in a ship’s
pantry. Many of my articles are made for vessels’
use, as I deal much with seafaring men.”</p>

<p>Arthur Brown, who was of quick sympathies,
was interested in the old gentleman, and touched
by seeing a man of his years, apparently infirm,
thus employed, felt inclined to converse, especially
as he spoke English.</p>

<p>“This is beautiful work,” he observed. “I have
seen a great deal of it in England and Germany,
where excellent work is made, but never any
superior to this. You are surely master of your
business.”</p>

<p>“I should be, considering I have been at it for
the greater part of my life since I was twelve
years old, and we have no knowledge that any of
our ancestors were ever anything but weavers of
sallies,&mdash;that’s what we call the rods the baskets
are made of.”</p>

<p>“You seem infirm. Have you been sick?”</p>

<p>“No, captain; I am worn down with wounds
and hardships, but, most of all, with a sore heart.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ve been a soldier?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; a sailor. I was born in Lincolnshire,
England, in the fens. There my forefathers all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
lived and followed their trade. A happier man,
sir, the sun never shone upon than myself. I had
an affectionate wife,&mdash;a right godly woman, and
thrifty,&mdash;and three children. I employed four,
sometimes five men. My oldest child was a boy.
He worked in the shop. We paid our rent easy,
and were getting along nicely, when, in the midst
of all this happiness, I was pressed, torn from my
family, and put aboard a hulk. Wouldn’t you
think, sir, that would break a man down?”</p>

<p>“I should, indeed, my friend,” replied Captain
Brown, greatly moved, “and I feel for you, from
the bottom of my heart.”</p>

<p>The tears were running down little Ned’s
cheeks as he sat propped up on the hen-coop.</p>

<p>“It must have been long ago,” continued the
captain.</p>

<p>“Not so very long, sir. Only about ten years.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“How old might you take me to be, sir?”</p>

<p>“Sixty, or thereabouts.”</p>

<p>“I am but forty-seven. Ought to be in my
prime. But O, sir, to have a wife and family, and
be forever separated from them, in a strange land,
and not know whether they are dead or alive, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
whether they are in distress or not,&mdash;only to know
that they are dead to you, and you to them,&mdash;it
keeps gnawing at the heart-strings.”</p>

<p>“It must, indeed. But how did you get clear
from the navy?”</p>

<p>“It was near the close of the American war.
The frigate I belonged to was in action with a
French seventy-four. I was wounded and flung
overboard for dead. The cold water revived me,
and I clung to the wreck of our spars, which were
shot away. The French vessel won the battle,
being a much heavier ship. I was picked up,
brought ashore at Toulon, and lay a long time in
the hospital, wishing for death; but I recovered,
and since then have, though feeble, made a living
by my trade. The people here are very kind.”</p>

<p>“What is your name, my friend?”</p>

<p>“Bell&mdash;John Bell, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why, that is the name of the man who built
this vessel, and is part owner.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I hope he is a happier man than
I am.”</p>

<p>“He is a happy man, and deserves to be, for he
tries to make others happy.”</p>

<p>The captain bought a good many articles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
basket-maker, and then sent him forward among
the crew, who purchased so largely that there
remained but very little to carry away. Peterson
bought a work-basket for Captain Rhines’s wife,
and Enoch Hadlock another for old Mrs. Yelf.</p>

<p>Walter was away, for, as he could speak French,
the captain had sent him to make some purchases
for him. Walter, indeed, had plenty of business
in this way, being spokesman for all hands.</p>

<p>The captain insisted upon the basket-maker
stopping to supper; but something in his appearance
prevented him from offering him money as a
gift,&mdash;he felt it might wound his feelings,&mdash;but
he gave him a cordial invitation to come on board
and eat or sleep, whenever his business led him in
that direction. The next night, when Walter
went over to see Ned, he mentioned the circumstance
of the basket-maker’s coming on board,
showed him his purchases, and told him he was an
Englishman, and that his name was Bell. This
excited Walter’s curiosity. He inquired further
about it, and Ned, who had been deeply touched
by the man’s pitiful story, repeated the whole conversation
between him and the captain, word for
word. When he concluded, Walter sat for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
moments, with his hands clasped over his knees,
as though striving to recall something.</p>

<p>At length he said, “Ned Gates, as sure as you
are lying on that bed, the basket-maker is our
Charlie Bell’s father.”</p>

<p>“Charlie Bell’s father?” said Ned, sitting bolt
upright, and then screaming at the twinge the
effort occasioned, because of his wound.</p>

<p>“Yes, Charlie Bell’s father.”</p>

<p>“But the man is an Englishman.”</p>

<p>“So is Charlie Bell.”</p>

<p>“I never knew that before.”</p>

<p>“He was an English boy; came to Elm Island
as poor as he could be, with some bad men,&mdash;but
he didn’t know they were bad when he started,&mdash;that
came to rob; but they came to the wrong
place, for Lion Ben most killed ‘em, kept the boy,
and brought him up. I’ve heard our Joe and Mr.
Williams tell about it a thousand times.”</p>

<p>“What if it should turn out to be so?”</p>

<p>“I tell you it is so; I’m certain sure it is. His
father was a basket-maker, and was pressed; I
heard Mr. Williams say so; and when they were
boys, Charlie, Mr. Bell, and John Rhines used to
make baskets, and Mr. Williams sold ‘em at the mill;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and when I first went to tend store for him, there
were some of ‘em in the store.”</p>

<p>“If your Joe or Mr. Williams were only here,
we could ask them, and know all about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Joe, they said, used to live on Elm Island
half the time before he was married. I remember
another thing Joe said.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“He said he made baskets of willows, and colored
them red, blue, and green, real handsome,
and said that was the way they did in England.”</p>

<p>“But the basket-maker said, if I remember
right, that it was about ten years ago, and that
his son was large enough to work in the shop at
light work. O, Walter, wouldn’t I be glad, and
wouldn’t the captain be glad (when Mr. Bell
saved our lives), to be the means of taking his
father home to him?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think somebody else would be glad
too, you little monkey, you?”</p>

<p>“The boys didn’t sleep much that night, having
worked each other up to such a state of excitement.
In the morning Walter went on board, full
of the news, and opened the whole matter to the
captain, who was as much astonished as Ned; being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
entirely ignorant of the antecedents of Charlie,
he supposed him a native of the country.
After patiently listening with the deepest interest
to all that Walter had to say, he acknowledged
that the probabilities were very strong, but, much
less sanguine, did not express a very decided
opinion.</p>

<p>“He said he had a wife and three children,” observed
the captain; “what became of them? were
they ever at Elm Island?”</p>

<p>Walter had never heard them mentioned; but
he was very young when Charlie came to Elm
Island, and might not have heard half that occurred.
Captain Brown turned the matter over in
his mind, and conversed with Walter, who daily
recollected some fresh corroborating circumstance,
till at length he determined, the next time the basket-maker
came on board, to broach the matter to
him, even at the risk of exciting unfounded hopes.
Day after day they expected his appearance; but
he came not. Walter searched the streets and
piers, but in vain.</p>

<p>The time of year now drew on when periodical
gales were expected, and the vessel would be
likely to go to sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“He may be sick, Walter,” said Ned; “for he
looked pale and half sick the day he was aboard.”</p>

<p>“He may be dead,” said Walter; “and we
never should know it, in this great city. I wish I
had seen him; if he was Charlie Bell’s father, I
could tell; I know I could see something of the
look.”</p>

<p>“I saw, when he pulled his hat off,” said Ned,
“that his hair, where it was not gray, is the same
color as Charlie’s.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">A STRANGE DISCOVERY.</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">CAPTAIN BROWN had employed Jacques
Bernoux, the French fisherman, to get the
spy-glass Walter had forgotten and left on the rock,
and he came on board, one morning, to bring it.</p>

<p>“Do you know a man who goes about the
piers and streets selling baskets? an old man,
and an Englishman?” said Walter.</p>

<p>“John Bell?”</p>

<p>“That’s the name.”</p>

<p>“Yes; pass his place every day going to my
boat.”</p>

<p>“Will you ask him to come on board the vessel
to-morrow?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Early the next morning the basket-maker
made his appearance with a large burden of
baskets; he had been so engaged manufacturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
that it kept him out of the streets&mdash;the reason
that Walter couldn’t find him.</p>

<p>The captain, taking him into the cabin, said,
“My friend, when you was here, a few days ago,
you gave me some particulars of your life. This
young man, Mr. Griffin, my mate, was not present;
but having heard what then passed between us,
he has not a doubt but that Charles Bell, who
built and is part owner of this vessel, is your
oldest son. As for myself, residing in another part
of the country, I have no personal knowledge of
the circumstances; but I must say that as related
by him, they seem to me most probable.
But you can hear what he has to say about it,
and judge for yourself.”</p>

<p>While the captain was speaking, the basket-maker
became very pale, trembled, and big tears
rolled down his hollow cheeks.</p>

<p>“For the sake of Heaven, captain,” he exclaimed,
“do not raise in this sad heart hopes that may
have no foundation. I’ve made up my mind to
endure the worst, as God shall give me strength,
till I lay these bones in the grave.”</p>

<p>“I am the last person to do that; but I have
been turning the subject over in my mind ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
since you were here last, and the more I reflect
upon the young man’s story, the more the probability
of it grows upon me.”</p>

<p>The basket-maker, hearing these words, made
a sign to Walter, who gave him substantially the
same statement he had made to Ned and the
captain. The old man was deeply affected; he
evidently saw strong grounds for believing the
person described was his child, but was fearful
of cherishing a premature hope.</p>

<p>“I can bear what I have borne,” he said, “but
the disappointment would drive me mad. You
say, young man, that you have known this person
intimately?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, as well as it’s possible for one person
to know another.”</p>

<p>“And that his name is Charles?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What’s his age?”</p>

<p>“I think about twenty-three.”</p>

<p>“My son, if living, would be twenty-three next
Michaelmas. What sort of a looking man is this
Charles Bell?”</p>

<p>“Hair, eyes, and complexion just like yours,
but he is not so large a man as you are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Those are the features of my boy,” replied
the old man, evidently gaining confidence as he
continued his inquiries.</p>

<p>“You say you didn’t know this Charles Bell
when he first came to Elm Island, and this Mr.
Rhines and his wife took him.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I was too young; but I’ve heard my
brother talk about it.”</p>

<p>“My boy,” said the old man, “was a most loving
boy, very much attached to his mother. I don’t
believe he would leave her and his brother and
sister. You never heard him mention his parents
or family&mdash;did you?”</p>

<p>“This Charles Bell’s mother is dead. I never
heard him speak of any brother or sister.”</p>

<p>“How do you know his mother is dead?”</p>

<p>“Because, sir, he went to St. John’s two or
three years ago, brought her body from there, and
buried it on his place, under an elm tree&mdash;a beautiful
spot. I’ve seen it a hundred times.”</p>

<p>The old man’s countenance fell. “It cannot
be,” he said, “that my wife, with young children
and small means, would leave England, and all her
and my relations, and go to the colonies; and yet
the time, circumstances, and personal appearance
of the young man tally precisely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know it’s your son,” said Walter; “nobody
can make me believe it ain’t. He looks as much
like you as my two hands look alike, saving the
difference in age, and his voice is like yours.”</p>

<p>“Do you expect to come here again, captain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we get off clear this time, and can run
the gantlet. You know it is all luck and chance
with us.”</p>

<p>“I can send a letter by you, and that will remove
all doubts, and settle the whole matter.”</p>

<p>“But I hoped you would feel sure enough to
take passage with us. You can do better in the
States than here.”</p>

<p>“I could not bear to go over there expecting
to meet a son, and be disappointed. I’m making
a very good living here.”</p>

<p>“I think you’d better go.”</p>

<p>“Well, captain, I’ve about as much as I can
carry at present, and am somewhat confused. I
will go about my regular business the rest of the
day; that will steady my mind; and perhaps I may
think of some question that this young man can
answer, that will throw more light on the matter;
and I will be on board again in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Resisting all solicitations to stop to dinner, the
old man departed with his load.</p>

<p>“I know it’s his son,” said Walter, as they were
eating dinner. “I feel it in my bones, and I think
we ought to persuade him to go.”</p>

<p>“I have not much doubt,” replied the captain.
“People are always emigrating from England to
St. John’s and Canada. Her relatives might have
gone, and taken her with them. I shall persuade
him in the morning to go, if I can.”</p>

<p>The second mate, who was a Marblehead man,
and had listened to the conversation, now inquired,
“Don’t all this crew belong right there?
and wouldn’t they be likely to know more about
it than Mr. Griffin? Most of them are much older
than he is.”</p>

<p>“To be sure they would,” cried Walter.
“There’s Danforth Eaton helped clear Elm Island
when Charlie Bell first came there; then there’s
Peterson, and Enoch Hadlock,&mdash;what a ninny I
was not to think of that before he went away!&mdash;there’s
not <i>one</i> of them but knows more about
his <i>first</i> coming there than I do.”</p>

<p>Leaving his dinner, Walter ran forward, and
soon returned, saying that Eaton knew all about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>When John Bell came on board the next morning,
he seemed calm, collected, and much more
hopeful. Sending for Eaton, the captain said to
him, “Eaton, I want you to tell us all you know
about Charles Bell’s coming to Elm Island, and
about his parents, if you know or have heard anything
about them, and I want you to begin at the
bottom.”</p>

<p>“What I know, cap’n, isn’t hearsay, but I had
it all from his own lips.”</p>

<p>“So much the better.”</p>

<p>“You see, cap’n, about that time there was
some Tories come up from the provinces&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We know,” said the captain, interrupting
him, “how he got to the island; but what we are
most concerned to ascertain is, who his parents
were, and how he came into the hands of those
pirates (for they were no better) who brought
him to Elm Island. Can you tell us anything
about that?”</p>

<p>“Reckon I kin tell you all about it; but I must
tell it in my own way. If you keep putting in
and interrupting me, I shall get all mixed up.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“You see, arter this boy come on the island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Lion Ben he hires me and Joe Griffin, the next
winter, to cut spars and clear land. Charlie Bell
was a little, slender, half-starved, pitiful-looking
creatur’, then, but he was willing and clever, and
soon begun to pick up. Most of the winter he
drove the team; but along in March, when it was
bad hauling, he helped me chop. I tapped a
maple, to have sap to drink while I was chopping.
One day we comes into the woods arter dinner,
and before we went to work, sot down by the sap
tree, in the sun. I sets on a stump, same as where
that stool is, and he on another, same as where
that old gentleman is setting. I takes a good
drink of the sap, and hands the dipper to him; says
I, ‘Charlie, tell me your history, or part of it, like
as you did Joe and Fred Williams.’ He didn’t want
ter, but I coaxed him. Then he said, the way his
father come to be pressed, was all through another
man, that courted his mother when she was a
gal, but she liked his father better; he couldn’t
give her up, and allers hild that old grudge agin
his father. He said his father had agreed to work
for the government, and if he had only got his
name on the roll, couldn’t have been touched any
more than if he had been a peer of the kingdom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
This feller, I forget his name&mdash;” “Robert Rankin,”
said the basket-maker. “That’s it, old man,
by jingo,&mdash;who thought, if he was out of the way,
he could get her, after all,&mdash;told the press-gang,
and they took him as he was on the road to the
place where he would have been safe.”</p>

<p>The tears were streaming down John Bell’s
cheeks, and his hands were lifted in gratitude to
Heaven; but he would not interrupt Eaton by a
question.</p>

<p>“He said, soon arter his father was gone, he
was killed in an action, and his mother carried on
the business for a while; but this feller kept prosecutin’
her, and wantin’ her to have him, till she
couldn’t stand it any longer. So she packed up
everything, and went to St. John’s, where she had
a brother; but when she got there, he’d gone to
furrin parts, and she took sick and died. Then
the boy, destitute and wandering about the streets
and docks to pick up a living, fell inter the hands
of them are reprobates, thinking they were honest
fishermen, and went cook for them. The rest you
say you know. Good as a story-book&mdash;ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Eaton,” said the captain, sternly, “this is Mr.
Bell’s father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“His <i>father</i>! Then he wasn’t killed. I didn’t
dream of that, or I shouldn’t have spoken like as I
did. I see now he favors him.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you,” asked the father, “what became
of the other children?”</p>

<p>“I axed him if there was any more of ‘em. He
said his mother’s relations took ‘em.”</p>

<p>There was an oppressive pause in the conversation
after Eaton had gone forward. John Bell sat
with his handkerchief over his face, while the others,
respecting his emotions, were silent.</p>

<p>“No doubt, there can be none,” he said, at
length, “that my poor wife is dead&mdash;God only
knows what she suffered, in poverty and among
strangers; that two of my children&mdash;whether
alive or dead I know not&mdash;are in England, and
that the other is in America. I may yet see <i>him</i>.
I ought to be thankful for that.”</p>

<p>“Your son, Mr. Bell,” said the captain, “is well
to do; able to provide you with every comfort;
and, what is more, respected and beloved.”</p>

<p>“And he owns land?”</p>

<p>“Yes; six hundred acres.”</p>

<p>“That seems like a dream to me, for none of our
folks ever owned a foot of land. I always loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the earth, and loved to work on it, even when it
was the freehold of another. I feel there may yet
be some happiness in store for me.”</p>

<p>“You are not an old man yet, Mr. Bell,” said
the captain, “and good news and good spirits will
make you ten years younger; so bring all your
things on board, and prepare to go with us, the
first gale that scatters the blockaders.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there is any doubt now. I
know there can’t be. Still, you know a person in
my situation feels they can’t be too certain; and
there is just one thing more that has come to
mind since I was here. I would like to ask of this
young man whether he ever noticed any scar on
my son’s face.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Walter; “it is on his right
jaw, and close to his ear,&mdash;runs up behind the
ear, into his hair.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll indulge no more in doubt. It would
be ungrateful. I never shall forget when he received
the cut that made that scar, it frightened
me so. Though it was long ago, it seems but the
other day.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen, Mr. Bell?” asked Walter.</p>

<p>“I suppose you never saw any basket rods
growing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“In England, we plant them in rows, three feet
apart, and as straight as an arrow. They grow
seven or eight feet high, and make a nice place
for the children to play. I was cutting the sallies
with a large knife, as sharp as a razor. My little
children, with their cousins, who had come to see
them, were playing hide-and-seek among the rows,
when Charlie ran in the way of my knife, and I
cut a dreadful gash in his cheek, that made that
scar. And now I will leave you, and make my
preparations for the voyage.”</p>

<p>“Not till you have taken dinner with us,” said
the captain; “and, Mr. Bell, I expect you to make
the vessel your home, and sleep here whenever it
suits your convenience.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, captain. My quarters on shore
are not so spacious or elegant that I should feel
inclined to refuse so handsome and hearty an
offer.”</p>

<p>When the meal was concluded, Mr. Bell went on
shore.</p>

<p>“Only see,” said Walter, looking after him, as
he went up the pier, “how quick he steps, and
how much straighter he is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a new heart in him,” said the captain.
“He’s something to live for and look forward to
now. In a week’s time he’ll be another man. As
far as I am concerned, I had rather carry <i>him</i>
home, than the richest cargo. And now, Mr. Griffin,
run up and tell the good news to Ned.”</p>

<p class="pch">HOMEWARD BOUND.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">NED had of late recovered rapidly, could walk
quite well, and was on board the vessel
very often, and went about the city some; but the
doctor advised that he should not go on board the
vessel to live till she was ready to sail. Ned had
not seen Walter since his promotion, but Peterson
had been up and informed him of it.</p>

<p>“Well, Ned,” said Walter, as he entered the
room, “it has turned out just as I told you it
would; the basket-maker is Charlie’s father, and
no mistake.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad, Mr. Griffin! and he will go back
with us&mdash;won’t he?”</p>

<p>“Ned, my boy, just leave that handle off, and
call me Walter, as you always did. It makes me
sick.”</p>

<p>“But you are mate now; Peterson told me so.”</p>

as we are now, you little monkey,” patting his
cheek.</p>

<p>“We shan’t sleep together any more,” said Ned,
in a desponding tone.</p>

<p>“No, Ned, I shall have to live aft; and that is
not the worst of it; we shall now be in different
watches.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I shall be in Mr. Baxter’s watch.
And we used to have such good times in our
watch on deck, talking about home, Pleasant Cove,
and all the folks there. Walter, who do you like
best of all the folks there, out of your own
family?”</p>

<p>“Charlie Bell.”</p>

<p>“So do I, and well I might. He saved my life.
Ain’t he handsome?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and just as good as he is handsome. A
first rate wrestler&mdash;there’s none of the young
ones can throw him but John Rhines and Ben
Peterson.”</p>

<p>“What, this Ben aboard here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, if I call you Walter all the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
when we are alone, that I shall forget to put the
Sir on sometimes before the men.”</p>

<p>“If you do, I shan’t hit you on the head with a
belaying pin.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what I could do, Walter.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I might swap watches with Enoch Hadlock.
He is in your watch.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you <i>could</i>, but I wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Then we should be in the same
watch again, and we could walk the deck, and
talk, and have good times together, as we used to.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Ned; if you should swap watches
with Hadlock, and get into my watch, it would
make trouble. If I happened to give you a soft
job, and somebody else a hard one, they would say
I was partial&mdash;made fish of one, and flesh of
another.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t be together any more for being
in the same watch. You would be forward, and I
should be aft.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t we be together when it was my
trick at the helm?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we couldn’t talk. It is against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
rules of the ship, and very unseamanlike, for an
officer, or anybody, to make talk with a man at the
helm. You couldn’t come aft to talk with me, and
if I should go forward to talk with you, it would
make growling directly, and set all the men
against you.”</p>

<p>“I see how it is,” said Ned, sadly. “The good
times are all over. There’s going to be a great,
high, solid wall, reaching clear up to the sky, built
right up between us.”</p>

<p>“O, not so bad as that, Ned. There will be
cracks and chinks in it, where we can peek
through, and boys must change into men some
time or other.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, Walter; but I wish the change
had not come quite yet.”</p>

<p>“I wish so, too. There’s time enough for me
these some years yet. But it would never have
done for me to refuse the berth when it was
offered me. It would have looked as though I did
not know how to appreciate kind treatment, and I
should never have had another offer. We can’t
have everything and keep everything.”</p>

<p>The ambitions, cares, and responsibilities of
practical life lay a ruthless hand upon the sympathies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and yearnings of young hearts, and the conversation
of the boys may, to the minds of older
persons who read these pages, recall similar experiences,
when the relations of master and servant
were rudely thrust between playfellows and near
friends.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Ned,” said Walter, noticing the
downcast looks of his friend; “we will sleep together
once more, at any rate. I’m going to stay
here to-night, and take you aboard with me in the
morning; that’s the order.”</p>

<p>When they were snug in bed, Ned lay for a
long time silent. Walter thought him asleep, and
had just begun to doze himself, when he was
roused by Ned exclaiming, abruptly, “I’m sure I
shouldn’t want to be a king.”</p>

<p>“Nor I either; I don’t believe in ‘em; but what
in the world has put that into your head just
now?”</p>

<p>“Well, I have been thinking over all the good
times we’ve had when we were in the same
watch, slept in the same berth, and ate out of the
same kid. In good weather we could sit side by
side under the lee of the boat, or under the rail,
and talk and enjoy ourselves. In our forenoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
watch below, we could comb each other’s hair,
tie our cues, read and study navigation; then, being
in the same watch, we always got liberty
ashore together. Right in the midst of all these
good times comes up this chief mate’s affair, takes
you right away from me, and sticks you up on the
quarter-deck. It’s no longer Ned and Walter; O,
no; it’s Mr. Griffin and Gates. I can’t speak to
you, for fear the men should think I was currying
favor; you can’t speak to me, lest there should be
growling about partiality. O, I shouldn’t want
to be a king, to be stuck up for everybody to look
at, and nobody to love. If people obeyed me, I
should know it was because they couldn’t help it;
if they pretended to love me, I should be sure
they lied.”</p>

<p>“But I ain’t a king, Ned.”</p>

<p>“No; but you are a mate, and if just being a
mate is going to make such an awful gap, what
must being a king make? It must be a lonesome
thing to be a king.”</p>

<p>“What a queer fellow you are, Ned! I always
thought you were about as spunky and ambitious
a boy as I ever knew. You wouldn’t want to be
a boy always&mdash;would you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; I don’t know as I should want to be
<i>always</i> a boy; but I don’t like stepping over the
edge all of a sudden; at any rate, I don’t like to
see everybody else stepping over, and leaving me
to be boy alone.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll get to be second mate next voyage,
and then we can be together again.”</p>

<p>“I might if I was older, or if I was only a Griffin,
or a Murch, or a Rhines, who are as big when
they are seventeen as others when they are men
grown. Here you are, a great fellow, your feet
sticking out of bed, while my toes are only down
to your knees.”</p>

<p>“But you are growing all the time; you can
steer a good trick now, and do anything that
your strength is equal to, as well as any man in
the vessel; you must be patient, Ned.”</p>

<p>“O, if I was only a little bigger, so that I could
furl the royal in wet weather, or when it blows
hard! I didn’t use to care so much for you, but
I should so hate to have any of the crew come up
to help me!”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a bunt-line rove for it.”</p>

<p>“O, thank you; then I can handle it any time.”</p>

<p>“Ned, do you think it is the beef makes the
man?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not altogether; but I think there must be
more beef than I’ve got.”</p>

<p>“That is a fault that will be daily mending: see
how much you’ve done since you left home; you
have obtained a very good knowledge of navigation.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have done so much, if I had not
been wounded. I have had lots of time to study
since I have been getting better; so there’s some
good come out of it. That’s just what mother’s
always saying&mdash;every thing is for the best. I
wonder if she’d been here the night I was hit,
if she would have thought <i>that</i> was for the
best.”</p>

<p>“I’ll warrant she’ll think it is all for the best,
Ned, when you get home safe and sound.”</p>

<p>“That she will, when she gets me in that old
bed again, prays with me and kisses me. Ain’t
I a great baby, Walter?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, Ned; you’re just right.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was good, Wal, just to please my
mother, it’s all she thinks about.”</p>

<p>“I wish <i>I</i> was, just to please Charlie Bell; at
any rate, we’ll do the best we can.”</p>

<p>“O, Wal, it’s nothing at all to be good here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with such a crew as this, all nice, steady men,
well brought up. You never sailed in an old
country vessel&mdash;did you?”</p>

<p>“No; I have only sailed with just such a crew
as we have here, and part of them are the same
men.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t know anything about it.
Such a set of reprobates as we had in that ship
I was cast away in, cursing, swearing, fighting
all the time; the captain never came on deck
without his pistols in his pockets; half the crew
didn’t know who their father or mother was; the
crew were fighting among themselves, and the
captain quarrelling with his mates, full of liquor
all the time; and such deviltry as they tried to
put into my head! I tell you, Walter, there
was not the least need of that ship being lost
(and I heard Mr. Brown tell Captain Rhines the
same thing); the men might have kept her free
just as well as not; we were not far from land.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they, then?”</p>

<p>In the first place, the men were harassed to
death, kept out of their watch, working up jobs
all the time, and half starved; the captain’s idea
seemed to be to keep them so used up that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
wouldn’t have strength or pluck to rise and take
the ship from him, and it came back on his own
head; they hadn’t strength enough, when the
ship sprung a-leak, to work the pumps; and besides,
they were so worn out, and hated him so,
that they were desperate, thought it was their
turn now, and if they could only drown him,
they didn’t care what became of themselves. I
tell you, Wal, I think, when a boy is away from
home, and thrown into bad places and bad
company, it makes a good deal of difference
how he’s been brought up, and whether he’s
come of nice folks.”</p>

<p>“I guess it does, Ned, because he has a good
character to sustain, and thinks, when he’s tempted,
‘How can I disgrace my folks? what would
my parents, brothers and sisters say? and how
would they feel if I should do this thing?’ Then
there’s another thing comes of being well brought
up.”</p>

<p>“What is that, Wal?”</p>

<p>“A boy that has been well brought up, and
has learning, has hopes; he knows he can make
something of himself, and means to; whereas
those poor fellows, who, as you say, didn’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
who their fathers and mothers were, had no ambition
or hope of ever rising, and so made up their
minds to enjoy themselves after their own fashion.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, for I’ve heard them say so. There
was one of them, my watch-mate, Dick Cameron,
a very decent fellow when the rum was out of
him, and I used to talk with him; but all he would
say was, ‘It’s all well for you, who have learning,
and friends, and a chance to be something; but it’s
no use for me.’”</p>

<p>“How big a man was Dick Cameron?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Why, I mean, how much did he weigh?”</p>

<p>“O, he was a stout, thick-set man&mdash;the strongest
man in the ship, and always took the bunt of a
sail. I shouldn’t wonder if he weighed nearly
two hundred.”</p>

<p>“Now, see; it’s just as I told you a while ago.
It isn’t beef that makes a man, but it’s pluck,
knowledge, and good principles.”</p>

<p>“And friends.”</p>

<p>“He’ll have friends if he has those things.
They will raise him up friends anywhere. Here
you are, fretting because you don’t weigh two
hundred, like Dick Cameron, and are not twenty-one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
But if anything should happen to the officers
of this vessel, all this crew of twenty great,
stout men, second mate and all, couldn’t get this
vessel home. They would have to fall back on
Ned Gates, if he hasn’t got any cue to speak of,
and can’t furl the royal when it blows hard, and
the sail is wet and heavy.”</p>

<p>“I won’t whine any more, Walter.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t make one farthing’s difference as
to age or size, with such a crew as this, all neighbors.
If you are only modest, and know your
duty, they would take pride in seeing you go
ahead.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t feel so any more. Let us talk
about something else.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you when we can get together, and it
will be nobody’s business.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“When the voyage is up, then you can go home
with me to my house.”</p>

<p>“But shall we have time before the vessel goes
again?”</p>

<p>“Plenty. They will have to pick up a cargo.
The articles to carry, many of them, have to be
imported from other countries&mdash;the salt-petre
from England or the East Indies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wouldn’t I like it? Wouldn’t I have the best
time that ever was in this world?”</p>

<p>“You better believe it.”</p>

<p>“I shall see Charlie Bell and his wife, and the
baby, Lion Ben, Uncle Isaac, and old Tige.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll get Uncle Isaac, our Joe, and
Charlie Bell to go hunting with us. It will be
right in bear time, and about town-meeting time,
and they’ll have a wrestling match. Our Joe is
champion, but father can throw him; only he’s
done wrestling in the ring. But I suppose, if any
stranger came along, as Ricker did, he’d take hold,
for the credit of the place. But father never saw
the day he was so stout as grandfather. Did you
ever see my grandsir?”</p>

<p>“No, I never saw any of your folks but Joe.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s an old man now, but you can see, by
his great bones and cords, as big as an ox’s, what
he was once. When Hen, and I, and Will were
little boys, he used to get us up in the floor, and
set us to wrestling.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think an old man would care about
wrestling and such things.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t old <i>inside</i>; no older than ever he was.
O, I’ll tell you the funniest thing. You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
know, we milk seven cows, and have awful big
churnings. One rainy day mother had our great
churn, full of cream, sitting in the chimney corner,
because it was a rainy day, and father was going
to churn for her. Grandsir he ties a string to
the churn handle, sat in his chair, and held the
end of it, and told us boys to jump over it, and
see which could jump the highest. Every little
while he would put the string up a little higher.
It was Hen’s turn to jump, and just as he was
going over, grandsir twitched up the string, and
caught his feet. Over went the churn, the cover
came out, and there was that cream all over the
floor. Grandsir was too old to get out of the
way; it filled his shoes full, ran into the fireplace,
and soaked Hen all through in front before he
could get up. The dog lay asleep before the fire.
It ran all over him. He jumped up, and went all
round the room, switching his tail, and flinging the
cream over everything. We laughed; it frightened
the baby; he began to scream, and you
never saw such a scrape.”</p>

<p>“What did your mother say?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t say much. She is one of the best
mothers that ever was, always one way. She isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
religious, like your mother, ‘cause there ain’t any
religion in our folks. She is too good to have
such a tearing set of boys round her.”</p>

<p>“Will you go in the woods, and camp out? I
never was in the big woods. There ain’t any
woods round Salem.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s woods enough round our way.
It’s all woods. You can get bear’s grease enough
to make your cue grow three inches a night, and
eat bear’s meat till you grow big enough to fill up
the boots of a second mate. Come, let’s go to
sleep.”</p>

<p>When they went on board in the morning, the
wind was blowing fresh, and the sea beginning to
heave into the roadstead.</p>

<p>The captain made his way to the observatory
(taking Walter with him), from which he enjoyed
a view of the roadstead and all in it. Here he
sat, watching the blockading fleet with all the interest
with which a beleaguered rat contemplates
the movements of his enemy, the cat. Ned Gates
had been despatched to find Mr. Bell, and tell him
to get his things on board the vessel, accompanied
by the fisherman’s boy as pilot. Ned traversed
alleys and by-ways, till, in the dark, damp basement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of a squalid tenement he found the object
of his search. It was a wretched place, the walls
low and dripping with moisture; in one corner
was a large trough, nearly full of water, in which
the willow rods lay soaking, in order to make them
pliable to work; the floor was littered with pieces
of willows, of all colors, which had been trimmed
off; the walls were hung all round with willows,
stripped into thin shavings, and made into skeins.
In another corner was a rough berth, built up
like those on shipboard, where the old gentleman
slept, and on a shelf, at the head of it, his Bible;
evincing that, in his loneliness and sorrow, he
found consolation in the Word of God. There was
also a rusty stove, a few cooking utensils, a rickety
table, and some rough chairs, made of willow
with the bark on.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was seated on a wooden platform,
a little inclined, with his back against the wall,
employed in finishing a basket of such delicate
workmanship, such tastefully arranged and beautiful
colors, as to elicit the most unbounded expressions
of admiration from Ned.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was evidently highly gratified
with the praise bestowed upon his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am glad you like it,” said he; “I have spent
a vast deal of time and work upon it; indeed, it is
all I have done since I heard my son was living.
I design it as a present for my daughter, if I am
ever permitted to see her. It is said, self-praise
goes but little ways; yet, when I was working at
my trade in England, I had the reputation of doing
the best work of any man in the fens, and that is
saying a good deal. I used to think, when Charles
was growing up, he would make a first-rate workman;
but he has found better business than making
baskets.”</p>

<p>“He can do anything,” said Ned. “He can
make a ship, a bedstead, or a fiddle.”</p>

<p>“He takes that from his mother’s folks. They
were shipwrights and joiners; but mine were all
basket-makers, from the beginning. I’m going to
take my tools, some basket-rods, and dye-stuffs; the
rest I have given to a young man who learned his
trade of me.”</p>

<p>He then drew from a chest a pair of nice broad-cloth
breeches, silk hose, and other things to correspond,
a nice pair of shoes, with silver buckles,
and, arraying himself, accompanied Ned on board
the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The gale increased as the day wore away.</p>

<p>“There they go,” said the captain, as one of the
frigates loosed her topsails and made sail.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” said Walter, “they’ll find that when
the cat’s away the mice will play.”</p>

<p>The frigate was soon followed by another, till
at length only the line-of-battle ship remained.
Long she held on against a tremendous sea, till,
at length, Walter, who had taken her bearings
over a projecting point, exclaimed, “She drags;
she will have to go.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the men were seen mounting
the rigging, and she also joined the rest. She,
under short sail, drifted very fast to leeward. The
frigates, carrying all the sail they could smother
to, and sharper built, made desperate efforts to
keep to windward, and did better, especially one
which had been taken from the French, that outsailed
all the rest; but they all gradually fell to
leeward, leaving a clear offing.</p>

<p>“Good by, dear friends,” said Captain Brown,
highly elated with the turn matters were taking;
“sorry to part, but your room is better than your
company.”</p>

<p>When the basket-maker made his appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
with Ned, he was scarcely recognized by the captain
and Walter, so changed was his appearance,
and so sprightly were his looks. Noticing their astonishment,
he observed to the captain, “I had
contrived to lay by a little, by prudence and hard
work, for I couldn’t bear the thought of being a
pauper in a foreign land, and that I might have
somewhat to give me Christian burial; and I
thought I would fix myself up a bit, that my son
might not be ashamed of me, should I be spared to
see him.”</p>

<p>By twelve o’clock at night the gale moderated,
the brigantine got under way, and as the sun rose
was far beyond the reach of her enemies.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">DEAR-BOUGHT WIT.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">NED had been accustomed, in all ordinary
weather, to take his trick at the helm with
the rest; but the captain would not permit it for
the first fortnight out, greatly to the annoyance of
Ned, who prided himself very much on being able
to steer. Wheels were not in use then, and the
old-fashioned tiller with which vessels were steered
came against the hips, sometimes with a good deal
of force, and the captain was fearful of causing
Ned’s wound to break out again; neither would
he permit him to stand his watch. All day he was
on deck, pulled and hauled with the rest, and went
aloft.</p>

<p>As Ned didn’t care for turning in till nine, ten,
or even twelve o’clock, of a pleasant night, when
he had not been fatigued through the day, Mr.
Bell&mdash;who was naturally inclined to make all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
inquiries possible about his son, and the new country
to which he was going&mdash;sought out Ned in
the pleasant evenings, and whiled away many an
hour in conversation most interesting to both.
Ned described the personal appearance of the son
to his father, and also that of Lion Ben, told all the
stories he had ever heard of his enormous strength,
and his encounter with the pirates, recounted the
beauties of Elm Island, of Charlie’s farm, and
sketched the characters of Captain Rhines and
Uncle Isaac. No doubt the virtues and attractions
of Charlie received their just due in the description
of so enthusiastic an admirer.</p>

<p>“You say, Ned, that my son owns six hundred
acres of land.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and a saw-mill on it; and the machinery
came from England,&mdash;that is, the crank,
saw, and mill chain.”</p>

<p>“Why, a man must be immensely rich to own
so much land. There must be some mistake
about it.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, there ain’t; for Mr. Griffin, the mate’s
brother, his next neighbor, told me so, and I’ve
been in the mill. He owns more than that, sir;
he owns part of this vessel, and part of the Casco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
(a great mast ship of seven hundred tons), and one
fourth of the Hard-scrabble; and he built the
whole of them.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand how he came by so much
money at his age, for he’s not much more than a
boy now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Lion Ben, Uncle Isaac, and Captain
Rhines gave it to him, they think so much of him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that. People are not so fond
of giving away money. There must be some mistake.
All my forefathers have been prudent,
hard-working people, and never one of them
owned a foot of land.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I don’t know how it is, but I know <i>it
is so</i>. I will call Danforth Eaton. He can explain
it all, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“Do, young man.”</p>

<p>Eaton told Mr. Bell about the ventures that
Charlie sent in the Ark, which gave him the first
money he ever possessed; also about his learning
the ship carpenter’s trade; and astonished the old
gentleman by telling him that Charlie’s land cost
only seventy-five cents an acre. He also told him
about the building of the Hard-scrabble, and how
much money she made. Upon these matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Eaton was an authority, as he had worked on all
the vessels Charlie had built, and knew the whole
matter from the beginning, whereas Walter Griffin
was too young to be familiar with the events of
Charlie’s boyhood, and the information of Ned was
all second hand.</p>

<p>As the voyage approached its termination, the
excitement of the father increased. Ned was now
able to stand his watch, and often, at twelve
o’clock, the old gentleman would come on deck,
and spend the remainder of the night talking with
him and Eaton, and also with Peterson, whose acquaintance
he had now made.</p>

<p>When, by the captain’s reckoning, the vessel
was nearly up with the land, and men were sent
aloft to look out for it, he became quite nervous,
thinking, perhaps, the happiness of possessing and
meeting such a son was too great a boon. Again,
he imagined that he might die before the vessel
arrived, or that, after all, there might be some mistake.
“God only knows what is in store for me,”
he said, brushing the tear from his eye, as a joyous
scream from the royal yard, in the shrill tones of
Ned, proclaimed, “Land, O!”</p>

<p>Let us now see what the unconscious object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
all this solicitude is doing. He is about half way
between his house and Uncle Isaac’s, walking at a
smart pace, and with the air of one bound upon a
long walk. It was early autumn. As he approached
the house, he saw Uncle Isaac in the
barn floor, winnowing grain in the primitive
fashion.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Charlie. Go into the house.
I’ll be there in a moment. I’m almost through.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stop, Uncle Isaac. I’m going farther.”</p>

<p>“Where to?”</p>

<p>“Over to Mr. Colcord’s, to look at a cow. He’s
got seven. He told me I might have my pick of
them for fifteen dollars.”</p>

<p>“What! Jim Colcord?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have anything to do with him.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s the most narrow-contracted
creetur that ever lived. He soaks out mackerel,
and then takes the water to make hasty-pudding,
in order to save the salt. Robert Yelf worked for
him one year in haying time. Didn’t you never
hear him tell about his jumping into the loaf of
hot rye and Indian bread?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir; what did he do that for?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. One day, his wife had cooked all
her dinner in the brick oven, except some potatoes
that she had baked in the ashes. She had baked
beans, Indian pudding, a hind quarter of lamb, and
a great loaf of rye and Indian bread in an iron
pan that would hold a peck. He had a number of
hands at work for him, getting hay. He’s rich
the old screw, but so mean that he never allows
himself or his family decent clothes, and always
goes barefoot. He’s got a noble woman for a wife,
too, as ever God made, and a nice family of children.”</p>

<p>“I believe such men always get the best of
wives.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good deal so, Charlie, I guess. Well, as
I was saying, coming into the house that day, just
afore twelve o’clock, and seeing no pots or kettles
on the fire, he took it into his head that his wife
had made no preparation for dinner; that the
men would come in at twelve, have to wait, and
he should lose some time.”</p>

<p>“Whereas,” said Charlie, “the dinner was all in
the oven, and ready to be put on the table.”</p>

<p>“Just so. He instantly began to jump up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
down on the hearth, and curse and swear. His
wife, who was scared to death of him, began to
take the victuals out of the oven, to let him see
it was all right. The first thing she came to was
the great iron pan of rye and Indian bread, which
she put down on the hearth. Thinking, in his passion,
that this was all, he jumped right into it with
his bare feet.”</p>

<p>“I guess it burnt him some.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’d think so; if there’s anything in
this world that’s hot, or holds heat, it’s rye and
Indian bread. It stuck between his toes, and
scalded to the bone. He ran round the room,
howling and swearing, and the tears running
down his cheeks.”</p>

<p>“Served him right.”</p>

<p>“I think so. Now, if I were you, I wouldn’t
have anything to do with him; he’ll cheat you,
sure.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I can tell a good cow when I see
her.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you can; but he’s cheated as smart
men as you are. Let me go and trade for you.”</p>

<p>Charlie would by no means consent to that,
but set off on his errand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Uncle Isaac, as they parted, “it is
said, bought wit is good; perhaps it is, if you
don’t buy it too dear.” When, at length, at the
place, he was received by Colcord with the greatest
cordiality; but Charlie saw that the house and
all the surroundings accorded precisely with Uncle
Isaac’s description of his character.</p>

<p>Colcord himself was a meagre-looking being;
although in years, he was barefoot, and so was
his wife. Charlie also noticed that the small quantity
of wood at the door seemed to be rotten windfalls
and dead limbs of trees, though he possessed
a large extent of very heavily timbered woodland.
Three boys, whose dress barely served the purposes
of decency, completed this singular family.
The youngest, notwithstanding his rags and a certain
timidity of expression (the result of hard
usage), was a most intelligent, noble-looking boy,
with whose face Charlie instantly fell in love; his
heart went out to these boys.</p>

<p>“I have known hardship and poverty,” he said
to himself, “but I thank God I never had a father
who, when I asked him for an egg, would give me
a scorpion. <i>My</i> poor father did all in his power
to give me schooling, and make my childhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
happy.&mdash;You remember,” said Charlie to Mr.
Colcord, “the talk we had some time since about
cows, when you told me that for fifteen dollars
I should have my pick out of seven. This is the
day set, and I have come to look them over.”</p>

<p>“Andrew,” said Colcord, to the oldest boy,
“drive the cows into the yard.”</p>

<p>After Charlie had examined each cow in succession,
he said, “Mr. Colcord, here are but six cows;
I was to have my choice of seven.”</p>

<p>“It is true, Mr. Bell, I did say so; but when I
came home and told my wife, she took on at such
a rate about my selling <i>that</i> cow, that I’ve tied her
up in the barn. She won’t consent to part with
her; it would break her heart. You must excuse
me there.”</p>

<p>Charlie’s suspicions were roused in an instant.
All that Uncle Isaac had told him in respect to the
sharp practice of the man rushed at once to his
recollection. He was determined to have that
cow, at any rate, and instantly asked to see Mrs.
Colcord, intending to make her a present, to reconcile
her to the loss of the cow; but he was told she
had gone away to spend the day.</p>

<p>“The old rascal,” soliloquized Charlie, “has shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
up his best cow, thinking I wouldn’t notice there
were but six in the yard.&mdash;Mr. Colcord,” he said,
“it was a fair contract between us. You agreed
to let me take my pick of seven cows. I am here,
according to agreement, with the cash. I’ll have
that cow, or none.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I <i>must</i>, I must,” said the old man;
“but my wife will cry her eyes out;” and he flung
open the cow-house.</p>

<p>Charlie felt so sure that this was the best cow
of the herd, that he never stopped to examine her
closely, asked no questions, didn’t even take hold
of her teats, to see if she milked easy, or to examine
the quality of the milk, but put a rope on
her head, and drove her off, congratulating himself,
all the way along, that he had outwitted the
old sneak.</p>

<p>“Guess Uncle Isaac won’t say any more about
bought wit,” thought he. “Couldn’t have done
better than that himself.”</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon when
Charlie reached home. At the usual time his
wife went to the barn to milk, and began with the
new comer.</p>

<p>“She has got nice teats, and milks easy, at any
rate,” said Mrs. Bell.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of her mouth
when the cow gave the pail a kick so vicious as to
send it spinning over the floor, spattering her with
milk.</p>

<p>“It is because she is in a strange place, and is
afraid of a stranger,” said Mrs. Bell; and, holding
the pail in one hand, she continued to milk with
the other. The cow began to kick, first with one
leg and then the other, without an instant’s intermission,
so that to milk was impossible.</p>

<p>Charlie, who was in the barn-yard, milking the
other cows, now came to the rescue. “I never
saw a cow I couldn’t milk,” he said; and taking
up one of her fore legs, fastened it to the rack
with a rope. “Kick now, if you can.” Placing
the pail on the floor, he began to milk with both
hands; but the vicious brute, springing from the
floor, fell over upon him, spilling the milk, breaking
the bail of the pail, upsetting Charlie’s milking-stool,
and leaving him at full length on the floor, in
not the most amiable mood (for his wife could not
refrain from laughing). He beat her to make her
get up, but she was sullen, and get up she
wouldn’t. He twisted her tail, but she wouldn’t
start. He then, with both hands, closed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
mouth and nostrils, strangling her till she was
glad to jump up. Thinking she had got enough
of it, he began again to milk, when away went the
pail into the manger, and the milk into Charlie’s
face. Provoked now beyond endurance, he beat
her till she roared; but the moment he touched her
teats, she began to kick as bad as ever. In short,
all the way he could milk her at all was to fasten
her to the stake next the side of the barn, build a
fence on the other side, so that she couldn’t run
around either way, then tie her hind legs together,
milk her till she threw herself down, and then finish
the operation as she lay.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, the dog kept up a
furious barking.</p>

<p>“What is that dog barking about, Mary?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. Perhaps there’s a
skunk or a woodchuck under the barn.”</p>

<p>If it was a skunk, he was peeping through a
knot-hole in the back barn-door.</p>

<p>As they came in with their milk, Joe Griffin was
approaching the door, having come to borrow a
chain and canting dog.</p>

<p>Charlie now perceived that the cunning old
wretch had shut up this pest, and feigned reluctance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to part with her, on purpose to draw
him on.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” said Mrs. Bell, “but what his
wife was at home all the time. He knew, if you
spoke to her, she would tell you the whole truth,
for she is an excellent woman.”</p>

<p>Charlie resolved to keep the thing from the
knowledge of every one, <i>especially</i> of Uncle Isaac,
whose assertion, “He has cheated as smart men as
you are,” recurred most unpleasantly to his recollection.</p>

<p>“Mary,” said he,” we must not breathe a word
of this to any soul,&mdash;father’s folks, Joe Griffin, or,
above all, Uncle Isaac. I had rather pocket the
loss than have it known that I got so taken in.
I’ll dry her up, and fat her. She’s a large cow,
and will make a lot of beef.”</p>

<p>But such things will always, in some way or
other, leak out. While Charlie imagined that himself
and wife alone possessed the secret, it was
known to half the town, and they were chuckling
over it. Indeed, it had come to the ears of Lion
Ben, on Elm Island, whose adopted son he was.</p>

<p>A fortnight after the occurrences related, Fred
Williams and Joe Griffin were standing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
doorway of Fred’s store, when they espied Lion
Ben coming from Elm Island in his big canoe,
which he was forcing through the water with
tremendous strokes.</p>

<p>Landing, and dragging the heavy craft out of
the water as though she was an egg-shell, he
merely nodded to Joe and Fred, and proceeded
with rapid strides in the direction of Charlie
Bell’s.</p>

<p>“What can that mean, Joe?” asked Fred. “He
never spoke to us.”</p>

<p>Fred was his brother-in-law, Joe one of his most
intimate friends.</p>

<p>“It means that he is angry. Didn’t you notice
his face? I never saw him angry, though I’ve
known him ever since I was a boy; but I’ve heard
say he is awful when he rises. A common man
would be no more in his hands now than a fly in
the clutch of a lion.”</p>

<p>Ben went directly into Charlie’s pasture, avoiding
him, hunted around there till he found the
kicking cow, and pulling a rope from his pocket,
put it over her horns, and led her in the direction
of Colcord’s. Uncle Isaac was butchering a lamb
at his door when Ben came along with the cow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and was just about to speak to him; but catching
one glimpse of his face, he dropped his knife, and
pretending not to see him, walked into the barn.</p>

<p>“Isaac,” cried his wife from the window. “<i>Isaac</i>,
Ben has just gone by.”</p>

<p>“I saw him.”</p>

<p>“<i>Saw</i> him; then why didn’t you speak to him,
and ask him to come in, and stop to dinner?”</p>

<p>“He’s got the cow Jim Colcord sold to Charlie.
I guess he’s on his way to call the old viper to
account for his trick. When he is in one of those
rages you’d better go near a she catamount than
him.”</p>

<p>“Will he murder him?”</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>“It is some ways there. Ben can’t hold his
passion long, and will most likely get over it somewhat
before he gets there.”</p>

<p>“If he don’t, much as I abhor the old creetur,
I pity him.”</p>

<p>When Ben arrived at Colcord’s the family were
at dinner; seeing an ox cart in the barn-yard, he
tied the cow to it. He entered the kitchen without
knocking, where the family were seated at the
dinner-table, seized old Colcord by the nape of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
neck, carried him, pale as a ghost, with eyes starting
from their sockets, and too nearly strangled
to scream, into the barn-yard; here Ben sat down
upon the cart-tongue, flung his victim across his
knees, and while he was alternately screaming murder,
and begging for mercy, slapped him with
his terrible paw, till the blood came through his
breeches, while the family looked on, crying and
trembling.</p>

<p>Ben, as a redresser of wrongs, considered it his
duty, not only to inflict punishment for his knavery
in the matter of the cow, but likewise for the
abuse he had for years inflicted upon his uncomplaining
wife and children.</p>

<p>When he had finished the castigation, he ordered
him to bring the money Charlie paid him for the
cow, and ten dollars additional for his trouble in
whipping him. Colcord brought the money,
but, fearing to approach Ben, put it on the cart
tongue.</p>

<p>After counting it, Ben called for a basin of
water, soap, and a towel, observing, that he was
accustomed to wash his hands after handling carrion,
and informing him (after wiping his hands,
as he hung the towel on the wheel of the cart)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
that, if compelled to come there again, he should
most probably make an end of him.</p>

<p>That night Charlie hunted the pasture over in
vain for the cow; but the next morning Uncle
Isaac came over, told him where the cow was, and
handed him the money, which Ben had left with
him on his return.</p>

<p>“How did father find it out?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Captain Rhines told him.”</p>

<p>“Who told Captain Rhines?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Who told you?”</p>

<p>“Joe Griffin.”</p>

<p>“How in the world came he, or anybody else,
to know anything about it?”</p>

<p>“That’s more than I know; but he said you
had to build a fence round her, and tie her hind
legs together to milk her, and when she couldn’t
kick, she’d lie down.”</p>

<p>“I bought wit pretty dear, Uncle Isaac.”</p>

<p>“Not quite so dear as Jim Colcord did. They
say he can’t sit down, and won’t be able to till
snow flies.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">DEATH AND BURIAL OF TIGE RHINES.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">THERE is no animal that seems to be so
closely allied to man as the dog. He lives
in his master’s smiles, defends his person, guards
his property, and is grateful for the smallest favors.</p>

<p>In respect to other animals, they are naturally
shy; we must attach them to us by food and
caresses.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, a kitten, born in the house,
and her parents before her for generations; yet
the moment it gets its eyes open, it will round up
its back, and spit at the little boy or girl who approaches
to fondle it, and must be wonted; but a
puppy, why, the moment his eyes are open, he’s
right on to you, and you have hard work to keep
him from licking your face.</p>

<p>When the family leaves the house, the cat will
seldom, if ever, follow them, because she cares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
more about the place than the people; but the
dog’s home is where his master is.</p>

<p>John Rhines’s dog, Tige, a Newfoundland of
the largest size, possessed&mdash;as those who have
read the Elm Island stories know&mdash;a sagacity
greater than that which generally pertains even
to that noble breed.</p>

<p>Tige Rhines, as he was called, was known and
loved by both young and old, the protector and
playmate of all the children, and bore on his
neck a broad brass collar, on which were inscribed
the date of the year and the day on
which he pulled little Fannie Williams from the
bottom of the mill-pond, and many other things
that he had done.</p>

<p>For many years Tige had been gradually
losing his activity, and was quite infirm with
age. He had never been accustomed to leave the
home of his master, except when sent upon some
errand, with a basket or letter in his mouth, unless
with some of the family; but after Mary
and Elizabeth were married, he would once in
a while go to visit each of them in the forenoon,
stop to dinner and tea, see the babies, and go
home at night. He would also go down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
cove in front of the house, and play with the
children of the neighborhood by the hour together.
All through Fannie Williams’s childhood
(whose life he saved) he was, whenever she
came up to see him, which was generally once a
month, sent home with her by Captain Rhines.
But age, which comes alike upon dogs and men,
had compelled him to relinquish all these pleasant
excursions. His legs had grown stiff and
crooked; his glossy black coat had become a
dirty yellow, except along the back and at the
roots of the tail; his intelligent eye was dim;
and all around his eyes and nose gray hairs
were plentifully scattered. It was with great
difficulty he could walk; he would attempt sometimes
to follow John to the barn, go part way
there, and moan because he could get no farther;
then John would go back and pat and comfort
him. Everything that care and affection could
do to render him comfortable and happy in his
old age, was done by Captain Rhines and John.</p>

<p>As the weather grew cooler, John made him
a bed of sheep-skins with the wool on; for though
once apparently insensible to cold, never hesitating
in the dead of winter to plunge into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
waves, he now trembled before every blast.
Captain Rhines would catch smelts and bring
to him, for Tige was a dear lover of fish; John
would put him in the cart, haul him down in the
field, and put him in the sun, at the end of the
piece where he was digging potatoes, and as
the sun went down, cover him with his jacket.
The children around brought him titbits, and
all the dogs in the neighborhood came to visit
him. He at length became so feeble it was with
difficulty he could get out of his kennel. Mornings
when John went to the barn to feed the
cattle, he would bid him good morning; Tige
would wag his tail and look wistfully in his face,
unable to rise.</p>

<p>One morning, John, as he passed the kennel,
spoke, as usual; but not hearing the noise of Tige’s
tail striking against the side of the house, he went
back and looked in; he was stretched out, apparently
asleep; he put his fingers in his mouth;
there was no warmth. “He is dead! poor old
Tige,” cried John; “there never was such a dog
in this world, and never will be again. I never
will love another dog;” and he burst into tears;
“I don’t care if I do cry,” he said, at length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
wiping away the tears; “he’s been my playmate,
ever since I was a boy; has saved my life; and
nobody sees me; but if Charlie and Fred were
here, they would cry, too.”</p>

<p>Captain Rhines was not yet up. John fed the
cattle, and then went to the door of his bedroom.</p>

<p>“Father.”</p>

<p>“What is it, John?”</p>

<p>“Tige’s dead.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry; poor fellow! I’d give the best cow
I’ve got in the barn to have him back as smart as
he was once.”</p>

<p>“<i>I’d</i> give them <i>all</i>, father.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve done all we could for him, John,
and he’s gone where the good dogs go. It will
make Ben feel bad; he and Tige were great
friends.”</p>

<p>“And Fannie, father.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>It was soon known in the neighborhood. About
nine o’clock, Fannie Williams came in, now grown
to be, by universal consent, the prettiest girl in
town; industrious, capable, and, as Captain Rhines
was accustomed to say, as good as she was handsome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is Tige dead, John?” she asked, taking the
chair he proffered her.</p>

<p>“Yes, Fannie.”</p>

<p>She was silent for a few minutes, then began
to cry.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Fannie,” said John.</p>

<p>“I know it’s foolish, but I can’t help it; you
know he saved my life.”</p>

<p>“That he did,” said the captain; “for I took you
from his jaws, when he brought you to the shore.
I would cry as much as I had a mind to.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” said Mrs. Rhines, “I don’t see
what anybody could be made of, not to feel bad
to lose such a good creature as Tige, even if he
was a dumb animal. I used to feel just as safe
with him, when Captain Rhines was at sea, and I
left alone with the children, as though the men folks
were round. When Captain Rhines was about home,
or we had a hired man, he would lie under the big
maple, or, if it was cold weather, in his house; but
the very first night I was left alone, he would
(without my saying a word to him) come right
into the house, and, after I went to bed, stretch
himself out before my bedroom door; it seemed as
if he knew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Knew!</i> I guess he did know,” said John; “only
think how long he smelt us before we got here,
when Charlie and I came from Portland, and how
glad he was to see us! I thought he would have
jumped out of his skin.”</p>

<p>John persuaded Fannie to stop to dinner, as
Tige was to be buried in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Where would you bury him, father?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, John. Under the big maple,
where he loved so much to lie in the hot summer
days.”</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on at Captain
Rhines’s, Joe Griffin, Charlie, and Fred were
expatiating upon the merits of Tige, and regretting
his loss, in Fred’s store. Joe Bradish came
in, and after listening a while to their conversation,
broke in with, “Such a fuss about a dog&mdash;an
old dog, that ought to have been knocked on
the head years ago. Anybody would think it was
a Christian you was lamenting about.”</p>

<p>Fred was naturally of a warm temper, shared in
the universal feeling of dislike to Bradish, and
this rough remark, in his present state of feeling,
was more than he could bear.</p>

<p>“There <i>was</i> more Christianity in him than there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
ever was in <i>you</i>,” retorted Fred; “more in one of
his nails than in your whole body. He saved the
lives of three of us, when we went to sleep in the
tide’s way, at Indian Cave. If it hadn’t been for
him, I should have been as miserable to-day as
Pete Clash. It will be news to me when I hear
of your lifting a finger to help anybody. You
may keep still or leave the store.”</p>

<p>Bradish, without making any reply, went out.</p>

<p>“You’ve lost his custom, I reckon,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“It won’t be much loss. He came in here the
other day, lolling round, and upset the inkstand
upon a whole piece of muslin. I was out of doors,
and before I could get in, it went through the
whole piece. He said he was master sorry, supposed
he ought to buy something, and would take
a darning-needle.”</p>

<p>The three friends, with Fannie and Captain
Rhines’s family, buried Tige beneath a large rock
maple that stood on the side of the hill, in the
edge of the orchard. It was all full of holes,
where Ben and John had tapped it. Between its
roots they had made many a hoard of apples; and
here Tige had loved to lie, as it was a cool place,
and from it he could see everything that moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
upon the water. They put a stone at the grave,
on which his noble deeds were recorded.</p>

<p>John Rhines had long cherished a secret attachment
to Fannie Williams; but the death of Tige
occasioned a mingling of sympathies that brought
matters to a focus, and after a short engagement
they were married. Captain Rhines and his wife,
with whom Fannie had been a favorite from childhood,
were highly gratified; for since their daughters
had married and gone, the large house seemed
lonely, and this beautiful, lively, sweet-tempered
girl was to them a perfect treasure.</p>

<p>A week after the occurrences narrated, a stranger,
in the dress of a working man, with his coat
on his arm, came into Fred’s store, and called for
some crackers and cheese, and half a pint of new
rum.</p>

<p>Fred placed before him the crackers and cheese,
but told him he must go to the other store for the
liquor. He then called for a quart of cider.
After eating, drinking, and resting a while, and
smoking his pipe, he took a piece of chalk from
his pocket, and drew a line across the floor.
“There,” said he, “the first man that steps over
that line has got to take hold of me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>This was altogether too much for Fred, who
instantly stepped over the line. They went out
before the door, and the stranger threw Fred in a
moment, and several others who came in. The
thing was noised abroad, and quite a crowd assembled,
but they were careful not to step over the
line. Fred sent for Charlie, and the stranger
threw him. The matter was now getting serious;
the reputation of the town was at stake.</p>

<p>“Send for Joe Griffin,” said Uncle Isaac.</p>

<p>Joe had gone up river after logs.</p>

<p>“Then send for Edmund Griffin.”</p>

<p>He had gone with Joe. A boy was now despatched
for Joel Ricker, who brought back word
that he was on Elm Island, doing some joiner-work
for Lion Ben.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Uncle Isaac, “we must send for
the Lion. This fellow shan’t go off and make his
brags that he has stumped the place, and got off
clear. I’ll take hold of him myself first, though I
haven’t wrestled these twenty-five year.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t we thought of John Rhines?”
said Fred.</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” said Uncle Isaac; “he’ll handle
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“John,” said the captain, “has gone to Tom
Stanley’s to buy a yoke of oxen; but I’ve got a
horse that will go there and back in three quarters
of an hour, if anybody will drive him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” said Fred.</p>

<p>By the time John arrived, half the town was
there. A ring was made before the door.</p>

<p>“You’ve brought a man big enough this time,”
said the stranger, looking up at John, who towered
far above him.</p>

<p>They took hold. John threw him as easily as
he had thrown Fred, while shout after shout went
up from the crowd, who had been holding their
breath, in anxious suspense.</p>

<p>“You <i>crushed</i> me down by main strength,” said
the stranger; “but I would like to try you at
arms’ length.”</p>

<p>They took hold at arms’ length, and although
the grapple was longer, John threw him twice.</p>

<p>“You have stout men up in this place,” said he.
“I am thirty years old next July, and this is the
first time I’ve been thrown since I was nineteen.”</p>

<p>“<i>Men!</i>” said Uncle Isaac. “You have as yet
wrestled only with boys. Our men all happen to
be away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you call these boys, I should like to see
your men.”</p>

<p>“Here comes one of them,” said Uncle Isaac,
pointing towards the water.</p>

<p>The eyes of the stranger, following the direction
of his finger, rested upon the massive shoulders
of Lion Ben, who was approaching the shore
in his big canoe, pulling cross-handed, while Joel
Ricker, with his tools in his lap, was sitting in the
stern.</p>

<p>They landed, wondering much at the crowd assembled.
Ricker walked up the beach with his
tools, while Ben followed, dragging the canoe with
one hand over the gravel.</p>

<p>The stranger gazed with dilating eyes, as he
straightened up to his full proportions. Then he
went to the canoe, but found himself unable to
move it, even down hill.</p>

<p>“What may I call your name, friend?” asked
Uncle Isaac, approaching.</p>

<p>“Libby&mdash;Lemuel Libby, from Black Pint, in
Scarboro’.”</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac then introduced him to Captain
Rhines, John, and Lion Ben, at the same time informing
him that they were the father and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
sons. Libby gazed a moment upon these superb
specimens of manly vigor, and resuming his
clothes, said, “This is no place for common men,
like me. I’ll make tracks for home.”</p>

<p>“Not so, friend Libby,” said John. “Everything
has been done fair and above-board. There’s
no occasion for hardness. Spend the night with
me. I’ll take the horse, and start you on your
way in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Neighbors,” said Captain Rhines, who was
greatly delighted at the triumph of his son, “I
invite you all to take dinner at our house to-morrow,
at twelve o’clock; and Mr. Libby will stop
and eat with us.”</p>

<p>“The house won’t hold us, Benjamin,” said
Uncle Isaac.</p>

<p>“Well, the barn will. We’ll make two crews,
and set two tables.”</p>

<p>“John,” said Charlie, after the crowd had dispersed,
“do you remember what you said so long
ago?”</p>

<p>“No. What was it?”</p>

<p>“That you meant to be the greatest wrestler,
and marry the handsomest girl. I don’t see but
you are in a fair way to do both, if all tales are
true.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE MEETING.</p>

<p class="drop-cap13">LITTLE dreaming of the happiness in store
for him, Charlie, having gathered in his
harvest and husked his corn, now occupied himself
in preparing to put a hedge around his
mother’s grave.</p>

<p>A <i>hedge</i>. How significant that word to him,
reared amid the vales of Lincolnshire! It recalled
all the associations of his childhood, and of the
sunny spring mornings, when, sitting beneath the
shelter of the hedge-rows, he watched the ducks
sport in the pools below, while beside him the hens
were scratching and burrowing in the warm earth
beneath the bank for worms and grubs, and he, a
happy, careless boy, was pounding a willow stick
on his knee with the handle of his knife, to make
the bark slip, for a whistle; listening to the birds
in the hedge above him, and watching the mimic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
waves produced by the wind as it swept over
the osiers.</p>

<p>His intention was to surround the little promontory
(around whose sides murmur the clear
waters of the brook and the majestic elm that
shadows it, whose pendent branches, with their
extremities, approached within a few feet of the
grave-stone) with hedge.</p>

<p>Mr. Welch, several years before, had imported
plants from England, and also ivy. It was from
him he expected to obtain his plants&mdash;“quicks”
Charlie called them&mdash;for he was no novice in
hedging. The ivy he purposed to plant at the
roots of the great elm.</p>

<p>This occupation had revived all the associations
of his boyhood, and fond recollections of other
days, often bringing tears to his eyes.</p>

<p>“A beautiful land is England,” said he, as he
wiped the sweat from his brow and rested upon
his spade; “and those sweet spots in the fens I
shall never forget; but this is sweeter, for it is my
own. What I do here, I do for myself, my wife,
and little one.”</p>

<p>That evening, as he sat with the babe in his
lap, while his wife was clearing off the supper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
table, he said to her, “Mary, it don’t seem to look,
or to be, just right that I should have a grave-stone
for my mother, and none for my father,
brother, and sister.”</p>

<p>“But they are not buried here. You wouldn’t
wish to put stones where there are no bodies.”</p>

<p>“But I might have <i>something</i>. I’ve seen in the
churchyards at home monuments with the names
of people on them who were not buried under
them, but had died at sea, or been killed in battle,
as father was. I might do that.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I think I will; and the very next time the
schooner goes to Boston, when I send for my
quicks and ivy, I’ll inquire of Mr. Welch about it.”</p>

<p>Here the conversation was interrupted by the
entrance of John Rhines, with a letter in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Just give me that baby, and read this.”</p>

<p>“If ever I was glad of anything in my life, I am
of this,” said Charlie, when he had read the letter;
“not on our account altogether, but Captain
Brown’s, he was just starting in life, and there
were so many looking at him; and how handsomely
he speaks of Walter and little Ned!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ain’t it great?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she’s paid for herself with the freight
she carried out.”</p>

<p>“I know it; and the back freight is all clear
gain. There’s no loss, except the main boom and
a boat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll build another boat. I’ve got the stuff in
the ship-yard, all seasoned. The boom won’t be
much; he can buy the stick, and Danforth Eaton
can make it. What did your father say? He was
a long time making up his mind whether it would
do to trust him with a vessel or not, and I know
he’s been very anxious, though he said nothing.”</p>

<p>“<i>Say!</i> I only wish you could have seen him
when I brought in the letter. Mother was just
going to tie his cue; he glanced over it, jumped
up, and cut round the house like a boy of sixteen;
made me put the saddle on the mare, and in spite
of all mother could do, went over to tell Uncle
Isaac, with his hair all flying in the wind. Won’t
they have a good time, talking it over?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I know just what they’ll say.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“They’ll say he’s turned out just as they expected,
when it was all you, father, and I could do
to get them started to build the vessel for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be too confident, Charlie; the old folks
know a thing or two; remember the cow trade.”</p>

<p>Charlie blushed, and in order to turn the conversation,
remarked, as he looked again at the
letter, “It seems he wants some beef and fish
to make up his next cargo.”</p>

<p>“Fred has got a lot on hand, just packed;
father is going up in the Perseverance to take
it up, settle up the voyage, and bring home the
money. Have you heard the news, Charlie, Tom
Bannister brought?”</p>

<p>“No; what is it?”</p>

<p>“Pete Clash and John Godsoe have turned up.”</p>

<p>“They have?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Tom saw ‘em on board a Guineaman in
Havana; they pretended not to know him, but
he knew them. Just the place for them. Father
says these Guineamen have a long gun in the
hold, and mount it when they get outside, and
are all pirates in disguise.”</p>

<p>The country, especially around the sea-coast,
was now in a prosperous condition. The settlements
were pushed back to the head waters
of the streams, roads made, townships surveyed,
town incorporated, and vessels built; the timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
trade assumed vast proportions, and money was
abundant, men began to break away from the rigid
manners of the primitive times, and ape the style
of dress and living that prevailed in England,
which they had either seen or heard of.</p>

<p>Great numbers of cattle were raised on the
lands newly burnt over. Instead of driving the
cattle to Brighton or Cambridge, as at the present
day in seaport towns and country villages,
they were butchered, and the beef packed at
home, shipped to Spain and other countries of
Europe, and smuggled into Cuba for the use
of the Spanish slavers. Fred had added to his
other business that of packing beef, and Uncle
Isaac and Joe Griffin bought the cattle for him.
He had imported a cooper, by the name of Wallace,
from Standish, to make the barrels, who had taken
three boys as apprentices, thus increasing the
business of the place.</p>

<p>Charlie, who as our readers know, was strongly
attached to the cultivation of the soil, had neither
engaged in vessel or boat building since the
Arthur Brown was launched. John Rhines likewise
found plenty of employment upon the home
farm, occasionally working in the yard of Reed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and Atherton, who came from Massachusetts, and
set up ship-building, built vessels, and took them
to Massachusetts for sale.</p>

<p>Charlie, Fred, and John intended only to build
vessels as they wanted them, and repair old ones,
or aid some industrious, enterprising young man,
who wanted a vessel.</p>

<p>They were influenced to this line of conduct
very much by the opinions of Uncle Isaac, who
had a most wonderful power of making people
think as he did; one reason of which was, that he
never manifested the least assumption, and another,
that he always placed matters in such a
light that those with whom he conversed seemed
to convince themselves.</p>

<p>One day Uncle Isaac and the boys went pigeon
shooting together; as they were sitting by the
fire after dinner, he said. “Where did that corn
come from that Seth Warren carried last vige in
the Hard-scrabble?”</p>

<p>“From North Carolina,” replied Fred.</p>

<p>“Yes, and where did that cargo you are grinding
now, that’s going into the logging camps, come
from?”</p>

<p>“From Baltimore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you take in any corn now from round
here?”</p>

<p>“When I first began to trade, I used to take in
a great deal; but now, except from yourself, Captain
Rhines, Ben, Joe Griffin, and one or two
more, I don’t get five bushels in a year; but I sell
lots to the people round here.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me, when a people get so much
taken up with building vessels, fishing, cutting
masts and ton timber, to send to England, that
they have to go to the southerd to buy corn to
export, feed their cattle in the logging swamps,
bread their families, and fat their hogs, they are in
rather a poor way; that there’s more talk than
cider; that they ain’t getting rich so fast as they
appear to be; when they raise but little except on
burns, never hauling out their dressing, or
ploughing the land, but keep going over and over,
skimming and skimming, that by and by they
will have a very poor set of carcasses left, and
that if there should come a war, and all this exportation
be stopped, there would be pretty blue
times. I don’t pretend to know, but it appears to
me that’s about the way things are done round
here, and all over the District of Maine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never thought of that before,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“Nor I either,” said John.</p>

<p>“It’s just as Uncle Isaac says,” said Fred, “just
to a T. When I first began to trade, almost
everybody had a few bushels of corn to sell, some
a good deal; and I never sold a bushel of corn, or
meal, except to fishermen from some other place;
if any of our people wanted corn, wheat or barley,
they went to their neighbors.”</p>

<p>“I have thought a good deal about it,” said Uncle
Isaac, “and I’ve talked the matter over with
Captain Rhines and Benjamin; it strikes them
pretty much as it does me; they ought to be better
judges than me, because they’ve had greater
privileges. I helped about the Hard-scrabble and
the Casco, because I wanted to start you boys,
build up the place, and make business; but it
never will do to have the eggs all in one basket,
for all to be ship-builders, lumbermen, or fishermen.
A ship don’t produce anything; she is herself a
product, manned from the land, and victualled from
the land; everything comes from the ground; we
ourselves were made out of it; there must be farmers
to feed the rest. I mean, for the future, to
put my money into the land, except I see special
reasons for helping somebody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Hard-scrabble was built, Captain
Rhines and Ben rigged her, and made the sails, as
also those of the Casco, and the Arthur Brown;
but after Reed and Atherton began to build, a
rigger and sail-maker came into the place. Charlie
Bell built the first pair of cart wheels, that had
an iron tire. Uncle Isaac and Captain Rhines
for some time had the only wagons; but in a few
years, carts and wagons were more common, and a
blacksmith from Roxbury, who could do carriage
work and make edge tools, bought out Peter
Brock.</p>

<p>The meeting between Captain Rhines and Arthur
(his boy, as he called him), in Boston, was a
most interesting one. The old captain was jubilant
that all the owners were more than satisfied, and
his own judgment, in respect to the capacity of
the young captain, borne out by facts.</p>

<p>Though by no means given to the melting mood,
he met his protégé with moistening eyes. It is
not within the province of language to describe
the joy that thrilled the breast of Arthur Brown,
and shone in every feature, as he put his hand in
that of the captain, resulting from the consciousness
that he had more than answered the expectations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and justified the confidence reposed in him
by his own friends and those of his father, especially
of Captain Rhines, Charlie, Lion Ben, and
the others who had risked their own lives to save
his, and, not satisfied with this, had also jeopardized
their property, to open before him a path to
usefulness and honor.</p>

<p>“Where are the boys?” asked Captain Rhines,
after he had talked half an hour with Arthur.</p>

<p>“They started for home in a coaster yesterday.
I have shipped them all for the next voyage.”</p>

<p>“Where is Peterson?”</p>

<p>“Gone with them.”</p>

<p>“Walter and little Ned?”</p>

<p>“They went to Salem together after the vessel
was discharged; are coming back to-morrow, expecting
to go home with you, or whoever came
up. Then you’re fully satisfied with me, captain?”</p>

<p>“<i>Satisfied!</i> My dear boy, I should have been
satisfied if you had done half as well. There’s
not a shipmaster in the country but would be
proud of much less than you have done.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bell and your sons are satisfied?”</p>

<p>“Why, to be sure they are. I don’t know what
they could be made of, if they are not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Arthur, laying both his hands on
the captain’s shoulders, “I have brought home in
this vessel that which will afford greater satisfaction
to Mr. Bell, yourself and family, than all the money
I have made this passage. I have brought home
Mr. Bell’s father.”</p>

<p>“You must be jesting, or have been deceived.
His father has been in his grave for years.”</p>

<p>“No; he was not killed, as was supposed, but
carried a prisoner to France. He has told Eaton
and Peterson the whole story of his impressment,
just as they say Charlie told it; told his son’s age,
looks, and the scar on his face. There’s no mistake&mdash;can’t
be. You’ll say so when you see
him.”</p>

<p>“God ‘a mercy! Well, this is news indeed.
But you didn’t mention it in your letter.”</p>

<p>“His father didn’t want me to.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“He’s gone to ride with Mr. Welch. I am to
meet him there, and take tea, and then he is coming
aboard.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go there to tea. I have a standing invitation.
Well, if I ain’t glad! What do you suppose
Charlie was about when I came away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“He was getting ready to put a hedge round
the spot where his mother lies; sent up by me to
get the plants of Mr. Welch, and wanted me to
talk with him about a monument that he wanted
to put up to his father’s memory, and a brother
and sister that he has heard died in England; and
also to get some plans and bring home to him.
And now, instead of the monumental plans, he’ll
have the man himself.”</p>

<p>[The Mr. Welch referred to here is a wealthy
merchant and ship owner, an intimate friend of
Captain Rhines, in whose employ he had sailed
the greater part of his life. His son James, a
young man of singular promise, but broken down
by intemperance, was sent by his father to Elm
Island in order to get him out of the way of temptation,
and restored by the influence of Uncle
Isaac.]</p>

<p>“But,” continued Captain Rhines, “the boys
will be home before us, will see Charlie, and let
the cat out of the bag.”</p>

<p>“No, they won’t; I’ve told them not to.”</p>

<p>The Perseverance had now been away ten days,
and Charlie was expecting to receive his “quicks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>”
at her return. He had, in the spring, ploughed
the ground intended for his hedge, and planted it
with potatoes, to subdue the tough sward. Having
dug the potatoes, and spaded in a heavy coating
of manure, he was busily engaged (on one of
those delightful autumn mornings when the hoar
frost is melting from the grass, and dripping from
the extremity of the leaves, and the muscles feel
that joyous thrill which the season of the year
inspires) in levelling the surface with a rake, removing
the stones, twigs, and bark that had fallen
from the elm. Feeling a hand laid lightly upon
his shoulder, he raised his eyes, and looked Walter
Griffin full in the face.</p>

<p>“Why, Walter,” he exclaimed, taking both his
hands, and struck with the expression of heartfelt
joy which pervaded every feature, “how happy
you look!”</p>

<p>“I hope so. I’m sure I ought to.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t any happier than I am,” said a voice
that Charlie well knew; and stepping from behind
the great tree, Ned Gates ran into his arms.</p>

<p>“Why, Ned, how you have grown! I should
hardly know you.”</p>

<p>“Have I, truly, Mr. Bell?” replied Ned, excessively
pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; and see what a cue he’s got,” said Walter,
turning him round.</p>

<p>“Be still, Wal; how you do like to poke fun
at me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bell,” asked Walter, “can you bear good
news?”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“But you never had any such news as this.”</p>

<p>“I stood it pretty well when the Ark made her
great voyage, and when Isaac Murch made so
much money in the Hard-scrabble. I guess I can
stand this,” replied Charlie, thinking Walter was
about to tell him how much the Arthur Brown had
made.</p>

<p>“O, it ain’t about money at all, but it’s something
that will make you gladder than if you had
a pile of gold as big as Elm Island.”</p>

<p>“Then it must be that you have given your
heart to God, Walter.”</p>

<p>The tears came into Walter’s eyes in a moment.</p>

<p>“And do you think so much of me, Mr. Bell?”</p>

<p>“Just so much.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is not that. <i>Your father has come.</i>”</p>

<p>“My father, Walter, is dead, and I am preparing
to put up a monument to his memory, right where
we stand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“You needn’t put up any monument, for he’s
alive and well, and in Captain Rhines’s house
this minute.”</p>

<p>Charlie turned pale, staggered, and would have
fallen to the ground, but was so near the elm that
he fell against it. Walter put his arm around him,
and he leaned his head on his friend’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“What made you tell him that way?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to; but when he spoke to me
about giving my heart to God, I didn’t know what
I said.”</p>

<p>“It’s over, now,” said Charlie, lifting his head
from Walter’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t killed, Mr. Bell,” said Ned, “though
he was flung overboard for dead. The French
picked him up, and we found him in Marseilles,
selling baskets.”</p>

<p>“I will go right up to Captain Rhines’s,” said
Charlie. “You stop at the house till I come
back.”</p>

<p>“I must go home,” said Walter; “and Ned is
going with me. I haven’t been home yet. I
didn’t want anybody to bring this news but myself
and Ned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>When Charlie&mdash;his pale features still manifesting
traces of the feelings which had mastered
him&mdash;entered the sitting-room, the captain, taking
him by the hand, pointed to the door of the parlor,
which stood ajar.</p>

<p>We will draw a veil over the meeting of father
and son; but when, at the expiration of half an
hour, they came out together, traces of tears were
on the cheeks of both, but they were tears of joy.
When Charlie presented his wife to his father, and
placed the child in his arms, “I can now,” said the
happy grand-parent, “say, in the words of old
Jacob, ‘I had not thought to see <i>thy</i> face, and lo!
God hath also showed me thy seed.’”</p>

<p>As they sat side by side, the old gentleman with
the child on his knee, Captain Rhines said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I don’t see how anybody who ever saw Charlie
could harbor any doubt about Mr. Bell’s being
his father&mdash;they favor each other so much.”</p>

<p>“Ah, captain,” was the reply, “put an old,
faded, red shirt on me, all stained up with osier
sap, a tarpaulin hat, a bundle of baskets on my
back, and, more than all, the heart-broken look I
wore then, you yourself couldn’t have found much
resemblance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>As they returned to Pleasant Cove by the road
that wound along the slope of land towards the
house, skirting the sugar orchard, the sun, which
was now getting low, illuminated with its level
rays the whole declivity, falling off in natural
terraces to the shore, and flashed upon the foliage
of the rock-maples, now red as blood. Indian
Island, with its high cliffs rising up from the glassy
bosom of the bay, the white trunks and yellow
leaves of its masses of tall birch contrasting with
the darker hues of the oak and ash, with which
the edges of the bank were fringed, presented a
mingling of tints most delightful.</p>

<p>Mr. Bell, upon whom the glories of a New England
forest in autumn produced all the effect of
novelty, was, for a while, silent with wonder and
delight.</p>

<p>He at length exclaimed, “How grand, how
beautiful! And is all this land and forest yours,
my son?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father, and a great deal more than you
can see from here. I bought four hundred acres
first, and two hundred more afterwards. Father,
do you see that large island, with a cleared spot
on the side of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“With a house on it, that looks as though it
were on fire, the sun is shining so bright on the
windows?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the one; that is Elm Island, where
Lion Ben and his wife live, who have been a
father and mother to me. God bless you, old
Elm Island. What happy years I have spent on
you!”</p>

<p>They next proceeded to the little promontory,
and Mr. Bell stood beside the grave of her from
whom he parted, in bitterness of heart, when he
was pressed on board the hulk at Sheerness.</p>

<p>“Poor Mary! She starved&mdash;saw poverty and
sorrow enough in this world; but I believe she
is now experiencing infinitely more happiness than
would be hers, were it in our power to call her
from the grave to join us. I am glad, my son,
that you have not set these quicks; we’ll make
the hedge together. When I am gone, you can
lay me in this beautiful spot beside her.”</p>

<p>They sat together beneath the elm, talking, till
the stars began to come out one after another;
and when that night Charlie knelt down to pray,
it was with a heart full to overflowing with gratitude
and joy.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">NED AMONG THE GRIFFINS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IF a boy ever enjoyed himself in this world,
Ned Gates did among the Griffins. Their
rough, but kindly, rollicking ways just suited his
sanguine temperament, and he suited them, from
the youngest to the oldest, and got through the
crust at once. Indeed, there was everything a
wide-awake boy would naturally like. There was
a charm, in itself, about such a jolly house-full.
Ned thought Edmund Griffin was a splendid man,
his wife one of the best of women, and as for the
old grandfather, despite his rough ways, he was a
perfect treasure. Evenings, Ned would nestle to
his side, and coax him to tell him stories about
river driving, hunting, wrestling, and the Indian
wars, in which he had taken a prominent part.</p>

<p>Captain Brown had rewarded Jacques Bernoux
very handsomely for the assistance he had rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Walter, and induced him to come to the
States, paying him seaman’s wages, and Walter
brought him home with him. Three or four more
never made any difference at Edmund Griffin’s.
Jacques afforded much amusement by his attempts
to speak English.</p>

<p>Being a leisure time of year, and the harvest in,
it was hunting, fishing, going to Elm Island,&mdash;Ned
and Captain Rhines carried the news of Mr.
Bell’s arrival to Ben and Sally,&mdash;going with Edmund
Griffin and Joe up river, and coming down
on the raft, breaking colts; and, to fill his cup of
happiness to the brim, Ned shot a moose. The
boys caught a bear in the trap, and Ned had an
opportunity to taste of the meat, and grease his
cue with the fat.</p>

<p>There was another older person having a good
time, and that was Mr. Bell. His things having
been brought to the house, he drew from the recesses
of an enormous chest the beautiful work-basket,
and some articles of household use, that
he had made while in Marseilles, and which had so
excited the admiration of Ned. Mary was delighted&mdash;she
had never seen anything half so
beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can’t come up to that, Charlie,” said his
father.</p>

<p>“No, father, I can’t. I never saw any of your
work so beautiful as this.”</p>

<p>“I never had quite so strong a motive before,”
said the old gentleman, smiling.</p>

<p>The next day Charlie was called from home to
run out a piece of land, and was absent nearly a
week. Finding lumber and tools in the shop, his
father made a trough to soak willow, a bench, and
having cut some native willows by the brook for
the frame, in order to economize the osiers, made
a chair for the baby, and when Charlie returned,
was busily at work making one high enough for
the child to sit at table in.</p>

<p>He was so much occupied with his work as not
to notice his son, who stood in the door watching
him.</p>

<p>“Father,” said he, “I should think I had got
back to Lincolnshire.”</p>

<p>“This is a better place than the fens, Charles.
I’ll tell you what I’ve been thinking about while
at work here.”</p>

<p>“What is it, father?”</p>

<p>“All through my life, at home, I have been accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to look up to the quality, and the country
squires who owned lands, with a sort of awe;
and I have been thinking what a pleasant feeling
it must be to own a piece of land that God made,
and that I should, before I die, like to experience
the feeling. Now, I have got a few pounds, that I
managed to lay up while in France. Why couldn’t
I buy a little piece of land, and have a little garden,
and plant it? It would seem so pleasant to
eat anything that grew on my own land. But perhaps
you’ll think I’m getting childish, and that it’s
an old man’s whim.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the way I used to feel at home,
father; and when I came to this country, I couldn’t
rest for thinking how I should ever come to own a
piece of land. I would do it. Sam Edwards has
a piece right on the shore he wants to sell. Part
of it’s cleared. There’s a small piece between it
and me that belongs to heirs, and is to be sold.
I’ll buy it, and then yours will join mine.”</p>

<p>“And I shall be a freeholder in my old age,
after living a tenant all the best of my life,” said
the old gentleman, highly gratified.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what you can do, father. Next
time the vessel goes to Marseilles, get Jacques to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
procure some sallies for you, set them on your
land, and then you can have an osier holt, grow
your own rods, and make all the baskets you like,
to pass away the time in the long winters we have
in this country.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they would grow here?”</p>

<p>“Anything will grow here, and there’s a swale
on that place will suit them exactly.”</p>

<p>The marriage of John Rhines and Fannie Williams
added to the general satisfaction. The infare,
or second-day wedding, took place at Captain
Rhines’s, upon which occasion half the town were
invited.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac and Joe Griffin met Walter and
Ned at the infare, and there made an agreement
to start the next week for the woods. Ned, who
had been kept quite closely at school till he went
to sea, and had never in his life shot anything
larger than a pigeon or squirrel till he came to
Pleasant Cove, was perfectly wild with the anticipation,
and kept Walter awake so long talking
about it, that he averred, if he didn’t keep still, he
wouldn’t sleep with him.</p>

<p>Charlie lent Ned a splendid gun, and they were
busily employed running balls and making preparations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>While the whole family at Edmund Griffin’s
were spending an evening in playing “blind man’s
buff” in the great kitchen, the old grandfather
looking on and enjoying the sport as much as the
rest, Joe, his face bathed in tears, came to announce
that Uncle Isaac was dreadfully hurt, and
could not live.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” inquired the grandfather,
the first to recover from the effect produced
by these sad tidings.</p>

<p>“You know what a hand Uncle Isaac always
was to work alone. He went into the woods to
haul a large log, laid a skid, one end on the
ground, the other on a stump, calculating to roll
the log up with the cattle, so as to run the wheels
under. He’s got a yoke of cattle that will do anything
he tells them to. He stood behind the log,
and spoke to the cattle, calculating to trig the log
when it was up; but the chain broke, and the log
came back on him.”</p>

<p>“How did they know about it?” asked Edmund.</p>

<p>“He spoke to the cattle, threw chips at them,
and started them home with a part of the chain
hanging to them; his wife knew something was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
wrong, got some of the neighbors to go, and
they brought him home.”</p>

<p>“He’s a very strong man; he may get over it.”</p>

<p>“No, he can’t, father; both legs are broken, and
he’s hurt otherways; the doctor says he can’t,
though he may live some time. I must go, for
I’m going to watch with him to-night.”</p>

<p>“Tell ‘em, Joe, to send here, night or day; anything
that we can do, it will be a privilege to
do it.”</p>

<p>As is the case when people feel deeply, little
was said, and one after another silently slipped
off to bed. As soon as Lion Ben and Sally heard
of it, they came over and stopped at Captain
Rhines’s. Ben, his father, and Joe Griffin gave
up everything to take care of and watch with
Uncle Isaac; for although the whole neighborhood
offered and pressed their services, he preferred that
they should take care of him. For some days he
suffered intense pain, and was at times delirious;
but as death approached, the pain subsided, his
mind became perfectly clear, and the same hearty,
kindly interest in the young that had ever been
a prominent trait of his character, resumed its
wonted sway. A few days before his death, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
sent for John Rhines, Charlie, Fred Williams,
Walter, and Ned, preferring, as he was not able
to talk with each one separately, to see them
together.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said he, “you have come to see the
last of Uncle Isaac. John, won’t you turn that
hour-glass. The sand is run out. We have spent
a great many pleasant hours together; they are
all over now; but I want to tell you that they
have been as pleasant to me as to you. It is
a great comfort to me that I have been spared
to see my children, and you, who seem as near to
me as my own children, grow up to be God-fearing,
useful men in the world, and settled in
life. It would have been a comfort to me to
have seen Isaac once more; but you must tell him
that his Uncle Isaac did not forget him in his
last hours. I have been a strong and a tough
man in my time. I never was thrown, seldom
pulled up; very few could lift my load, plan work
better, or bring more to pass with an axe or scythe.
I never saw but one man who could outdo me
in trapping game or with a rifle, and that was a
Penobscot Indian, and my foster-brother, John
Conesus. I have left my rifle with the walnut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
stock to him. I don’t fetch up these things in
any kind of a boasting way, but only to say to
you that all these matters that appeared great
to me once, and no doubt do to you, seem very
small now. What I like most to think about ain’t
what I’ve done for myself, but to help others,
especially to start young men, and get ‘em canted
right, because any good done to the young always
seemed to me to go a great ways. I always
did love to set a scion in a young stock; it ain’t
like grafting an old hollow tree, which, if it bears
a little fruit, soon rots down or blows over. If,
at your time of life, you feel and do thus, like as
when you caught the fish and gave them to poor
Mrs. Yelf, and when you tried to make a good
boy of Fred here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We never should have done either,” said John,
“if you hadn’t put it into our heads.”</p>

<p>“More especially, if you should be owned of the
Lord as a means of grace to some fellow-creetur,
you will find they will be the pleasantest things to
look back on, when you come to be where I am;
more so than chopping, wrestling, and getting property,
though they are all good in their place; such
thoughts smooth a sick pillow wonderfully. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
that I put any dependence in them, but in the
marcy of Him who gave me the heart to do
them.”</p>

<p>After resting a while, and taking some stimulant,
he motioned for Walter and Ned to come near.</p>

<p>“I hear that Captain Brown gives you a good
name, Walter, and that you came home his first
officer. We were about to go into the woods together
when I was hurt. I used to think you
loved to go into the woods with me.”</p>

<p>“O, Uncle Isaac, the happiest hours of my life
have been spent in the woods with you.”</p>

<p>“We never shall go there again; I am going to
a better place&mdash;to heaven. Walter, I hope we
shall meet there. I haven’t strength to say
more; but you will remember the talks we’ve had
at the camp fire. So this is the little boy we took
off the raft; he is not very little now, though.
Don’t cry, my son,” he said, laying his hand upon
Ned’s head, who had buried his face in the bed-clothes,
and was sobbing audibly. “It seems to me
I am the best off of the two.”</p>

<p>“How <i>can</i> that be, Uncle Isaac, when you are
hurt so dreadfully, while I am well?”</p>

<p>“Because, my son, I have got about through; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
have run all the risk, while you have just begun,
have all the risk to run, and may be shipwrecked. <i>I</i>
know what is before me&mdash;a better world; <i>you</i> don’t
know what is before you. <i>I</i> have had all <i>my</i> trials;
<i>yours</i> are to come. Captain Rhines tells me you
have a Christian mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Uncle Isaac, she’s the best mother that
ever was.”</p>

<p>“I had a praying mother; when I was younger
than you I was torn from her, and carried away
by the Indians. I never forgot her words; in the
great woods, all alone, they came to mind, and
through them I sought and found the Lord.”</p>

<p>After parting with the boys, he seemed prostrated,
fell into a doze, and passed away without
a struggle.</p>

<p>A few days after, Uncle Jonathan Smullen died,
from decay of nature&mdash;a very clever man, and kind
neighbor; and it was said of him, he never did
anybody any harm; but Uncle Isaac was missed,
and mourned by the whole community. The seed
of good principles he had sown in the minds of
young men kept coming up for years after he was
in his grave, and was resown by those who received
it from them, a hundred times; nor will
their influence ever cease.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pch">A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">SCARCELY had Uncle Isaac been committed to
the earth, when the nephew he had so longed
to see arrived in the Casco, sick with the fever
and ague. As the owners wished to send the vessel
with despatch to one of the French West India
islands, they, at Isaac’s request, put Ezra Aldrich
in her as master. He was a native of the place,
and relative of Isaac, but never much liked by his
schoolmates, being an overbearing fellow.</p>

<p>In his youth he went two voyages with Captain
Rhines, and afterwards in English ships from Liverpool
to Halifax.</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” said Captain Rhines, “what Isaac
wants to put him in her for.”</p>

<p>The first mate was an acquaintance and shipmate
of Aldrich, by the name of Percival, and, as
Captain Rhines told his wife, as great a rascal as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the captain. There was some difficulty in getting
a crew, but, through the influence of Captain
Rhines, who prevailed on Peterson and Danforth
Eaton to ship, a crew was mustered. Being all
young men from the neighborhood, who knew
their duty and were able and willing to do it, they
were at first rather amused than otherwise with
the consequential airs and bluster of their new
captain, in such strong contrast to the manners of
Captain Rhines and Captain Murch.</p>

<p>Aldrich seemed very much inclined to quarrel
with Peterson, but having a wholesome dread of
the strength of the black, restrained himself. By
continual abuse, he at length irritated the good-natured
negro to such a degree, that he said to
him, “Lookee ‘ere, Massa Aldrich; ‘member when
you little picaninny, runnin’ ‘bout barefoot; shirt
flap he stick out behind; your farder haul staves
on a hand-sled, your mudder dig clams; spose you
gib me any more your jabber-juice, fling you ober
de rail.”</p>

<p>A week passed, when the captain, offended with
Danforth Eaton, caught up the end of a rope to
flog him. Eaton took up another.</p>

<p>“What use do you intend to make of that rope,
Eaton?” asked the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just the same use that you make of yours.”</p>

<p>The captain was a school-mate of Eaton, and
knew very well the result of a collision with him.
But as they approached the land, the deportment
of the captain entirely changed. While the vessel
was being discharged, he bought soft bread, fresh
meat, vegetables, and even fruit, for the men.
Seamen are little disposed to remember injuries,
and all old scores were now rubbed out.</p>

<p>The cook having gone to the hospital sick, Peterson
had taken his place.</p>

<p>One evening, just as the men were about to
turn in, the captain sent Peterson ashore with
some letters. In the morning, when the crew
turned out, he was among the missing. There
was a good fire in the fireplace,&mdash;stoves were
not in use then,&mdash;the tea-kettle on, coffee pounded
in the mortar, some raw potatoes and onions peeled
and sliced, slices of raw pork in the frying-pan,
salt beef chopped in a kid,&mdash;everything prepared
to make lob-scouse.</p>

<p>“Was he not a drinking man?” inquired the
captain.</p>

<p>“He was once,” said Hurd, “but left it off years
ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Halloo! What’s this?” said George Hoyt.</p>

<p>A handkerchief lay on the fender. They
brought it aboard on the point of a boat-hook.</p>

<p>“It’s Peterson’s,” said Elwell; “there’s his
name on it.”</p>

<p>“It’s just as I thought,” said the captain. “He
drank last night; that waked up the old appetite,
and as soon as he turned out this morning he went
for more, and fell off the gangway plank.”</p>

<p>A grappling was procured ashore, and the crew,
under the direction of the captain, who was deeply
moved, grappled for the body the greater part of
the day, without success. In the meanwhile, the
mate was making inquiries on shore.</p>

<p>“The tide runs strong here,” said the captain;
“it has swept him to sea.”</p>

<p>“Poor Jim has gone, boys,” said Eaton, as,
weary and dispirited, they sat down to supper.</p>

<p>“Anybody wouldn’t have thought,” said Savage,
“he’d a broke through, after being a steady man
so long. The captain feels bad, but he’s done all
a man could do.”</p>

<p>“Jim Peterson,” said Eaton, brushing away a
tear with the back of his hand, “was a black fellow,
raal coal black, too,&mdash;a Guinea nigger, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
please; but if he’d been washed overboard, I’d a
risked my life to save him quicker than for any
shipmate I ever had; and I’m not all the one
would have done it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Dan. I’m sure I never thought
anything about his color.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t believe anything about his getting
drunk (though I’ve no doubt the captain
thinks so); for I’ve seen him tried and tempted
hard to weather, by old shipmates, time and time
again. He went ashore to get something to put
in the stew; a sober man might make a misdeal
in a hurry. No power on earth will ever make
me believe Jim was drunk.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t he sing out?”</p>

<p>“He might strike his head on something, and
stun him. There’s a good many will feel bad when
we carry the news home, besides his own folks.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Savage; “there’s nothing in
the world that the Rhineses wouldn’t do for Peterson,
and always would; and it was just so with the
Griffins. I’ve heard that Peterson saved the captain’s
life once. I remember one time a parcel
of us boys got some withes, tied them together,
and got a turn round Peterson’s waist when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
was so drunk he couldn’t chase us, and began to
pull him round. First thing I knew, I got a clip
side of my head that sent me a rod; when I picked
myself up, I saw the boys, some on the ground,
some runnin’, and Lion Ben right among ‘em. I
put her for home, and never stopped till I got
under mother’s bed; but the rim of my ear was
cut through, and my head was swelled for a week.
I tell you, I looked sharp for Lion Ben after that,
whenever I wanted to have any fun with Peterson.”</p>

<p>When the vessel arrived home, Captain Murch
took charge, and Aldrich went back to Liverpool.</p>

<p>Percival, the mate, got to drinking, and became
a miserable fellow; went to Boston, and sailed
before the mast, sometimes second mate, and after
his brief elevation, again before the mast; till,
becoming so notorious a drunkard that no captain
would have him, he was employed as a lumper
about the wharves in Boston.</p>

<p>The next volume of this series, “<span class="smcap">The Young
Deliverers</span>,” will explain the mystery attending
the disappearance of Peterson, and present the
characters of Walter and Ned in an entirely new
light.</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">EVERY real boy wishes to design and make
things, but the questions of materials and
tools are often hard to get around. Nearly all
books on the subject call for a greater outlay of
money than is within the means of many boys,
or their parents wish to expend in such ways.
In this book a number of chapters give suggestions
for carrying on a small business that will
bring a boy in money with which to buy tools
and materials necessary for making apparatus
and articles described in other chapters, while
the ideas are so practical that many an industrious
boy can learn what he is best fitted for in his life work. No work
of its class is so completely up-to-date or so worthy in point of thoroughness
and avoidance of danger. The drawings are profuse and excellent,
and every feature of the book is first-class. It tells how to make a boy’s
workshop, how to handle tools, and what can be made with them; how
to start a printing shop and conduct an amateur newspaper, how to
make photographs, build a log cabin, a canvas canoe, a gymnasium, a
miniature theatre, and many other things dear to the soul of youth.</p>

American boyhood and youth. The athletics are
technically correct, abounding in helpful suggestions,
soundly and wisely given, and the moral tone
is high and set by action rather than preaching.</p>

while preparing for college, is brought to face
the fact that his father, a benevolent physician,

bring much travel and many adventures,

the summer at his home on an island near New

whose highest purpose it is to watch over the
property and interests of their benefactor, and
to which they give his name. All profit in great
measure from a summer that is a turning point in
their lives. A story of reaping good by doing
good, bright and entertaining and full of life,
incident, and good sense.</p>

“Forty-Niners” from personal knowledge
and experience, and the very best one of them
is the noted historical writer, Col. Drake. One
of two young chums in Boston yields to the excitement
of the day and goes to California, partly
at his friend’s expense. Later, the hero of the story
is driven by injustice to make his way thither via
the route across Nicaragua, befriended by an old
sailor. A reunion and exciting experiences in San
Francisco follow.</p>

<p class="pn1 lmid">Phil and His Friends.</p>

<p class="pbq">The hero is the son of a man who from drink got into debt, and, after having
given a paper to a creditor authorizing him to keep the son as a security
for his claim, ran away, leaving poor Phil a bond slave. The story
involves a great many unexpected incidents, some of which are painful and
some comic. Phil manfully works for a year cancelling his father’s debt,
and then escapes. The characters are strongly drawn, and the story is absorbingly
interesting.</p>

<p class="pn1 lmid">The Tinkham Brothers’ Tide-Mill.</p>

<p class="pbq">“‘The Tinkham Brothers’ were the devoted sons of an invalid mother. The
story tells how they purchased a tide-mill, which afterwards, by the ill-will
and obstinacy of neighbors, became a source of much trouble to them. It
tells also how, by discretion and the exercise of a peaceable spirit, they at
last overcame all difficulties.”&mdash;<i>Christian Observer, Louisville, Ky.</i></p>

<p class="pn1 lmid">The Satin-wood Box.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Mr. Trowbridge has always a purpose in his writings, and this time he
has undertaken to show how very near an innocent boy can come to the
guilty edge and yet be able by fortunate circumstances to rid himself of all
suspicion of evil. There is something winsome about the hero; but he has
a singular way of falling into bad luck, although the careful reader will
never feel the least disposed to doubt his honesty.”&mdash;<i>Syracuse Standard.</i></p>

<p class="pn1 lmid">The Little Master.</p>

<p class="pbq">This is the story of a schoolmaster, his trials, disappointments, and final
victory. It will recall to many a man his experience in teaching pupils, and
in managing their opinionated and self-willed parents. The story has the
charm which is always found in Mr. Trowbridge’s works.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Many a teacher could profit by reading of this plucky little schoolmaster.”&mdash;<i>Journal
of Education.</i></p>

<p class="pn1 lmid">His One Fault.</p>

<p class="pbq">“As for the hero of this story ‘His One Fault’ was absent-mindedness.
He forgot to lock his uncle’s stable door, and the horse was stolen. In
seeking to recover the stolen horse, he unintentionally stole another. In
trying to restore the wrong horse to his rightful owner, he was himself arrested.
After no end of comic and dolorous adventures, he surmounted all
his misfortunes by downright pluck and genuine good feeling. It is a noble
contribution to juvenile literature.”&mdash;<i>Woman’s Journal.</i></p>

<p class="pn1 lmid">Peter Budstone.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Mr. J. T. Trowbridge’s ‘Peter Budstone’ is another of those altogether
good and wholesome books for boys of which it is hardly possible to speak too
highly. This author shows us convincingly how juvenile reading may be
made vivacious and interesting, and yet teach sound and clean lessons.
‘Peter Budstone’ shows forcibly the folly and crime of ‘hazing.’ It is the
story of a noble young fellow whose reason is irreparably overthrown by
the savage treatment he received from some of his associates at college.
It is a powerful little book, and we wish every schoolboy and college youth
could read it.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia American.</i></p>

<p class="pbq">There were some schoolboys who had turned housebreakers, and among
their plunder was a silver medal that had been given to one John Harrison
by the Humane Society for rescuing from drowning a certain Benton
Barry. Now Benton Barry was one of the wretched housebreakers. This is
the summary of the opening chapter. The story is intensely interesting in
its serious as well as its humorous parts.</p>

<p class="pn1 lmid"><b>His Own Master.</b></p>

<p class="pbq">“This is a book after the typical boy’s own heart. Its hero is a plucky
young fellow, who, seeing no chance for himself at home, determines to
make his own way in the world.... He sets out accordingly, trudges to the
far West, and finds the road to fortune an unpleasantly rough one.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Inquirer.</i></p>

<p class="pn1 lmid"><b>Bound in Honor.</b></p>

<p class="pbq">This story is of a lad, who, though not guilty of any bad action, has been
an eye-witness of the conduct of his comrades, and felt “Bound in Honor”
not to tell.</p>
<p class="pbq">“A capital book in all respects, overflowing with all sorts of fun and
adventure; just the sort of book, in short, that the young folks will be
anxious to read and re-read with as much continuous interest as the most
favored of their storybooks.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Leader.</i></p>

<p class="pn1 lmid"><b>The Pocket Rifle.</b></p>

<p class="pbq">“A boy’s story which will be read with avidity, as it ought to be, it is so
brightly and frankly written, and with such evident knowledge of the temperaments
and habits, the friendships and enmities of schoolboys.”&mdash;<i>New
York Mail.</i></p>
<p class="pbq">“This is a capital story for boys. It teaches honesty, integrity, and friendship,
and how best they can be promoted. It shows the danger of hasty
judgment and circumstantial evidence; that right-doing pays, and dishonesty
never.”&mdash;<i>Chicago Inter-Ocean.</i></p>

<p class="pn1 lmid"><b>The Jolly Rover.</b></p>

<p class="pbq">“This book will help to neutralize the ill effects of any poison which children
may have swallowed in the way of sham-adventurous stories and wildly
fictitious tales. ‘The Jolly Rover’ runs away from home, and meets life as
it is, till he is glad enough to seek again his father’s house. Mr. Trowbridge
has the power of making an instructive story absorbing in its interest, and
of covering a moral so that it is easy to take.”&mdash;<i>Christian Intelligencer.</i></p>

<p class="pn1 lmid"><b>Young Joe</b>, <span class="smcap">and other Boys</span>.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Young Joe,” who lived at Bass Cove, where he shot wild ducks, took
some to town for sale, and attracted the attention of a portly gentleman
fond of shooting. This gentleman went duck shooting with Joe, and their
adventures were more amusing to the boy than to the amateur sportsman.</p>

please the young folks.</p>

<p class="pn1 lmid"><b>The Fortunes of Toby Trafford.</b></p>

<p class="pbq">“A new story by J. T. Trowbridge, is, like all Mr. Trowbridge’s fiction, the
good wine that needs no bush. The plot is full of interest, and is still so
natural that it all might happen in a thousand places. Its scenes and its
people are everywhere; only few writers have Trowbridge’s eyes to see
them. The hero is not an impossibly good boy, but he has manly instincts;
and he is kept from follies and mistakes by the counsels of an excellent
mother, and of his wise and noble-hearted schoolmaster. Boys will follow
his career and his good and bad fortune with genuine interest.”&mdash;<i>Boston
Budget.</i></p>

<p class="pn1 lmid"><b>Father Brighthopes</b>; <span class="smcap">An Old Clergyman’s Vacation</span>.</p>

<p class="pbq">“To the many friends which this book will doubtless gain it may be well
to say that Father Brighthopes of the story gains that cheery name by his
readiness to always see the bright and not the dark side of any difficulty,
great or small. The few weeks which he spent with his friends, the Roydons,
wrought a change in their daily life as marked as it was pleasant. The
writings of Trowbridge are too well known to require comment, since almost
everyone is familiar with his straightforward, simple style, underlying
which there is not a little humor as well as pathos.”&mdash;<i>Chicago Times.</i></p>

<p class="pn1 lmid"><b>Woodie Thorpe’s Pilgrimage</b>, <span class="smcap">and other Stories</span>.</p>

<p class="pbq">“The scenes are full of human interest and lifelikeness, and will please
many an old reader, as well as the younger folks, for whose delectation it is
intended. As in all the books of this author the spirit is manly, sincere,
and in the best sense moral. There is no “goody” talk and no cant, but
principles of truthfulness, integrity, and self-reliance are quietly inculcated
by example. It is safe to say that any boy will be the better for reading
books like this.”&mdash;<i>St. Botolph.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
